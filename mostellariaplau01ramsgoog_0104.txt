neren nnn snosonv. nxxv

Quo nemo adaeque absentata ex omni Allt'ca,

there is no correption, as indicated by Weise, but an Anapaest in
the 3rd place.
Obltbeicende' is a quadrisyllable in Mil. IV. viii. 49 (Troch. Tetr.

cn), Massa mom asama· anaema· κωφὴ·

ansas a trisyllabis in Rud 11. vi. 58 (Senan),
Ibi nie corruere posse aiebas dar‘eltbs.

With regard to the line Mero. Prol. 29,
Inhaerel elram ambalat, assata, inebn'a,
which is sometimes referred toas an example ol o dropped, it is
scarcely possible to scan it as it stands, and Pareus is probably
right when he proposes to omit eham altogether.
The example ol a‘ao contracted, quoted from Aul. Prol. 5, depends

upon an unnecessary change in the reading oi the best MSS. In
Amph. IV. iii. 16 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Seu patrem sabe auom ae'debo ΙΙ optruncalo in adibeo,

we may either consider a‘oom ss a monosyllable, or s-erae as a mono·
syllable and totally elided. A good example ol asos as a monosyllable
occurs in Men. Prol. 44 (senaa),

El ipseo eodan esl ari-'oi vocam mmihe.

3. But this shortening or contractiori takes place in the middle
ol many words without the presence ol the letter o. ‘rbus aspero,
celmlos, manipules, gubernamlo, oracula, raama, peneulo, athaela,
barbae, and many others beconm apro, ce'rclos, maniplos, gubernaclo,
oracla, saecla, partile, athela lamnae, This takes place most sre-
quently when a short vowel in the middle of a word is separated
hom another vowel by a liquid, as in the above examples; but this
is by no means a necessary condition, sorve find caldior for calidior,
amab sor parilib, unaarum for unebersum, calfacti lor calefacit,
and Quintilian 1. 6, tells us that in bis time calfacit was more
common than calefacti.

4. Other contractione. When e is followed by another vowel in
the mme word, it frequently coalescas with it in dactylic verse,
generally, though not uniformly, from necessity. Thus we have aure‘a,
aloe‘art'a, eadent, eis-edem, respondeamus, aere't, αναπῑι, farei, alueo,
aare’o, eodan, eosdem.

So also oa is contracted in such words as co‘olueriial, co'operabnl.
