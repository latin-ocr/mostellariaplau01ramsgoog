xciv PROLEGOMENA.

V. ii. 34, Poen. IIL ii. aa, iii. 57, iv. aa, v. 26, V. vi. ιδ. The
following are in Anapaestic lines: Bac. V. ii. 64, Mil IV. ii. 69 (γι).
The line, Bac. 11. iii 38, cannot be scanned as it appears in the
MSS. Τίιε reading of Rud. V. ii. 27 is very doubtful.

Ex. There are some passages quoted from Plautus in which
the syllable ex appears to be short in the words ixemplum, exegere,
and exercetur.

For exemplam we are referred to Rud. 11. iii. 40 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),

Iactum exempli plurrmti meletae perpetuam nalem.

But auctam is an unskilful conjecture by Scheider; all the MSS.
have-

Iaclafae exemplis plurrhtri meierae perpensam noctem,

which presents no difficulty either in mette or construction, for
sociatae is here eqttivalent to abelam sunaus.
Exegere is quoted from Trin IV. iii. 46 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Sf mage exigere cupales duarum rerum exoratur optr'o.

hh the MSS. have ri mage,· A, F, have exigere ‚· B, C, D, E, have
ex ἔωσι, Α has coaptas-duarum ‚· all the rest of the MSS. cuprhs
duarum. Since the verb exegere and its tenses occur in at least
twenty passages in Plautus with the ex long, and this is a solitary
example on the other side, this is precisely one of those cases in

which a slight transposition may fairly he resorted to, and all difficulty
removed by reading-

Mage si exegere cupe'as duarum rerum exoretur ephi).

There is yet another method of avoiding thc supposition that ex
is shortened. Magis being one of those words which may be pro.

nounced as amonosyllablc, mage may be altogether absorbed, as yrot
unfrequently takes place in re'br‘, tibi, scie, mea, eum, &c

Exerceee and its tenses, exercitus and its cases, occur nearly forty
times in Plautus, and in three of these exercitam and exerce'tu appear
to have the first short. It is to be remarked that the whole of these
examples are in the Amphitruo, and two of them within a few lines
of each other in the Prologue-a portion of the play which contains
a number of metrical licences within a short compass, and with
regard to the genuineness of which some good scholars have enter-
tained grave doubts. The passages are as follows :—

Exercitus ι. Amph. Prol. 125 (Seras),

Quicum Ampheiruone abrit hinc in excreatum,
