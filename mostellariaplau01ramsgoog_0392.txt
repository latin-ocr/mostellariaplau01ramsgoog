EXCVRSVS XIV.-TALENT VM, MINA, dc. 249

with reference to their own curreney, signifies κατ’ dccxlv, the Numae
Serternirs. But the daily pay of the Roman soldier was certainly
hot three Sesatai· at this period

a. Plautus, Pseud. 1. i 95, makes Calidorus say, Quid ego m'fieam
Qua· nec paratas namur argenti rsit, Neque cuilr'dellac spes nimquam
gentiam from which we naturally infer that the namra argenti is
something different lrom the libella. But the Lr'della, according to
Varro (L. L. V. 5174, ed. Mun), was a' small silver ooin equal in
value to the topper Ar. Hence we may translate, ίΙ, who have not
got a shilling in my pocket, and bave no hope os procuring apenny
anywhere' It is quite true that libella is employed elsewhere (as it
is indeed here) by Plautus in the same sense as tribbolant and uranus,
to denote indefinitely a trifling sum, as in Cas. 11. v. 8, Quod si tu
nolr's, filrhsqus etaiam treas, Vobis tractabatque amborum ingratiis Vna
lr'della lr'bcr possum fiam* and that when Hegio says, Capt V. i. 27,
Aa ab eam rem meli biellam pra eo argenti rte duri, the meaning is
precisely the same as when he says, 11. ii. 81, Eum rr' reddis rarii,
praeterea unam aarum rte duta· but our object at present is to ascer-
tain whether the value os the ruamus, when used by Plautus to denote
a specillo sum or coin, is constant or variable.

3. Lastly, as to the passage Most 11. i. ro. When Lipsius and
others assert that the words trium nuaram carata referto the daily
pay os the Roman soldier, even il we were to admit that the words
really allude to the pay os the Roman soldier, it is a pure assumption
to take it sor granted that his daily pay is meant Supposing the tres
nanti equivalent to six drachmae or six denarzi‘ (sor, as we remarlred
above, the Roman writers are wont to regard the drachma and 'the
&narrar as equivalent), the tres numi would be equal to 60 arsa, or two
asses per day lor a month. That this may have actually been the pay
oi the Roman soldier when Plautus wrote is by no means improbable,
since it was only two obols or 33 asses per day inthe time ol Polybius,
although the wealth ol Rome and the importance of her armies had
increased enormously during the interval. This is amere conjecture,
and may be taken lor what it is worth, but we must bear in mind
that we have no prool whatsoever that the words ol Tranio refer to
the pay ol a Roman soldier. That three numi were occasionally given

* So again, Pseud. ll. it. 34, ‘libr‘ hbellam argenti numquam credam. No
specimen of the libella having ever been found, some numinnatoiogists
have most unreasonably maintained that there never was such a coin3 but
the words oi Varro (lc.) are perlectly distinct-“ Numi denarii decuma
libella, quod libram pondo aeris valebat, et erat ex argento parva.”
