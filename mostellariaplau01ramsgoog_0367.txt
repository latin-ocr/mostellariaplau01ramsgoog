having forgotten the name of Channides, from whom he pretended
to be the bearer of a letter, Charmides, who is playing with him, says
ironically-C. Vide, Ιιιιιιι, ιιι hominm noveris S. Tamquam me, ‘see

you now then, my good fellow, how far—to what extent—you are ζ
acquainted with this person‚' to which the Sycophanta replies, ‘I ,

know him as well as 1 know myself'

This is probably the force of ιιι in Bac. 11. ii 30, Into ιιι eum,
ιιιᾱιι, meiero αιιιαιιι desiderat: all the MSS. have ιιιιιι, for which
recent editors, following Acidalius, substitute eam, but if we punctuate
as above the change is unnecessary. We have already quoted this
line under ιἰιιι, p. ¹99 sub tin

InMost111.ii146(144) atis equivalent to quanto,· T. Vt ’

qur'cqurii magri contemplor, ιαιιιο magis placet.

4. Vt, ‘how,' in the sense ‘of what ltind' (quala), as in the
English phrase, ‘how is he as to temperl' thus in Stich. 1. ii 55,
where Antipho and Pinacium are discussing mulierum mores, the
latter says-P. Scio ιιι oportet ιιιι ιι· stit! ιἰα ιιι ego aequom ιιιιιιο.
Α. Volo scire ergo, ιιι aequom ιιιιιιι. Ρ. V! per urbem qttont ambulent,
Omm'bur os optarent ιιι quis mersio maledieo! sibi, where the first and
second ιιι are equivalent to 4ιιιαιιι,1 so in Cure. 1. i. 59, Imo ιιι ιἰιαιιι
cernes? it is clear from the context that these words are equivalent
to qualem illam ιιιιιιι ιιιι,· so Amph Prol. 104, Nom ego vos matisc
credo ιἀιιι ιιι ιιι pater meus, Quam libertorum rerunt multarunt siet,
‘I take it for granted that you know what kind of person my father
is, how he conducts himself,' be.

This force of ιιι may, not pnfrequently he represented by the =

English ‘ast’ Amph. III. iii. 4, Atque ιἰα servom par vr'detur frugi

sese instituere, Proinde lteri ιιι ιιιιι, ipse ιἰιιιι ιιι, where Proinde ιιι, ³

‘just as‚' is equivalent to quales ‚· so Capt. 11. i. 32, Ero, ιιι me voles

ιιιι, ‘I shall be as you wish me to be,' ie. ‘such as' ιιιιιι qualem i

and again, v. 39, Νιιιιι ιιι ιι milri vola esse, ιιιι autumn Truc. ΙΙ. vii
16, merelrr'cem ego ιἰιιιι esse reor mare ιιι ιιι, ‘such as is the scal
talem quale.

In Men. ΙΙ. iii. 78, Mus. Quin ergo? Men. Opus ιιι. Mus Qum
operaest? Meu. Scio, ιιι me dices. Mne Tanto nequtbr ιι.· the text
is probably corrupt.

. 5. Vt, ‘how‚' has frequently nn explanatory force in dependent l

clauses; thus in English, ‘1 will tell you how it happened,' ‘let us
consult how we may best assist him,’ and the like. In all such cases
ιιι, in Latin, must be followed by the subjunctive: Poen. 1. i. 66,
Abeamus zitlro ιιι Collubricunr 'villicum Hanc perdoceamus ιιι serat
