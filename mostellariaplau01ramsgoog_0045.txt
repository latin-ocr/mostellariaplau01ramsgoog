PROLEGOMENA.

Orthograplty ‘ff long Vowels.

Quintilian and some oi the later grammarians explicitly state that
in the earliest times long syllables were distinguished in writing by
doubling the vowel. Thus 1. Ο. Ι. vii. 14:

“ Semivocales non geminare diu fuit usitatissimi moris: atque c
contrario usque ad Accium ct ultra, porrectas syllabas geminis, ut
dixi, vocalibus scripserunt. Diutius duravit, ut e, i, iungendis, eadem
ratione qua Graeci a, uterentur. Ea casibus numerisque discreta
est, ut Lucilius praecipit '' &c

And Mar. Victor. p. 2456, “Naevius et Livius, curn longa syllaba
scribenda esset, duas vocales ponebant, praeterquam quae in Ι literam
inciderant, hanc enim per E et I scribebant.”

heting upon this principle, Dltntyar, who published an edition of
the fragments oi Livius Andronicus (Berol.1835), represents them
in the following iashion:

‘⁴ ln seedeis collocat see reegiaas
Clutaimneestra iuxtim, tertiana naatai occupant
* * * *
Quin, quod paareere voos maaiestaas mea
Procat‚ tolerastis, templooque banc deeduucitis.”

But in so lar as the doubling oi vowels is concemed, it seems
certain that no such system prevailed generally at the period when

ι our oldest inscriptions were engraved, and these belong to an epoch

as remote as Livius, and much more remote than Pacuvius, Accius,
and Ennius. Thus on the tombs of Scipio Barbatus and his son
we have CORNELIVS, BARBhTVS, PROGNhTVS‚ DVO-
wonwn, viarum, vos ossibus

The practice was not altogether unknown, ior we find alen
examples bere and there, but these are so rare that we might almost
ascribe them to ignorance or accident. In the whole os the twenty
inscriptions we have enumerated above there are only seven in·
¹ stances, and the whole ol these are found in lu (No. aoa Momm),
which is aa late as B.C. 81, viz. HAACE LEGE, HOICE
LEEGEI, SEESE twice, LVVCI (from LVX), and PEGVLATVV*
twice, while in the same inscription LEGE or LEGEM occur three
times, and LVCI twice.

d* Obserwe that both lusci and pegsdatau are anomalous on other con·
ai erations.
