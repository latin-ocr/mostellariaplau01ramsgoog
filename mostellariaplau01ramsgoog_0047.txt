xxviii PROLEGOMENA.

IVDICIVM, IVDICIO, IVDICET, IVDICARE, IVDICETVR‚
IVDICATA, also IOVSERIT and IVSERIT; IOVRET‚ IOV·
RENT, IOVRATO, and IVRATO‚ IVRARIT.

The caseos long ι’ deserves particular consideration We find
a multitude of examples from the earliest inscriptIons downwards,
In which it is represented byei, and this both in terminatione and
roots. Thus, VIRTVTEI, QVEI [1], QVEI, GESISTEL
SEI [4], QVOIEI, VIRTVTEL QVEI [5], PETIEI, SIBEI
[7], QVEI, FOIDERATEI‚ EXDEICENDVM, NEIQVIS,
SEI, QVEI, SIBEI, DEICERENT, VTEI, VBEI, IBEI,
CENIS, NISEI, OINVORSEI VIREI, NISEI, INCEIDERE·
TIS, PREIVATOD [10].

But this mode ol representing long i was not observed with
anythIng approaching to uniformity even in our most ancient
authorities: thus, AIDILIS [1], AIDILES, AIDILIS, BAR-
BATI [8], PVBLI, CORNELI [4], ACCVMVLAVI, GENVI‚
OPTENVI [7], but in the same inscription PETIEI [7],
VENIRENT, AVDITA, VRBANI, COVENTIONID, SACRI
[101.

The absolute uncertainty which prevailed upon this point is proved
by the Iex Thoria, in which we find not only FRVEI and FRVI,
HEREDEI and HEREDI, DEICITO and EDICITO, AGREI and
AGRI, both in the genitive, but such combinatione as POPVLEI
ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMANEI, POPVLI ROMANI; AGREI
LOCEI, AGRI LOCEI, AGRI LOCI ;. POPVLI LEIBEREI,
and many others*

This uncertainty seems to have disturbed literary men, for Lucilius
endeavoured to lay down rules which might determine the cases in
which ei should be employed to denote the long vowel, and those
ln which the simple ι’ should be used. Quintilian,† Velius Longus,‡
and Terentius Scaurush all refer to the prindples which he sought
to establish, and quote his words, but the passages are so obscure
and corrupt that it is very difficult to ascertain what his views really
were, It would seem that in nouas of the second declension he
wished to distingrdsh the numbers by writingpue71201'rr'in the
genitive singular and puerei urici in the nomInative plural, while In
nouns of the third declension he wrote ei in the dative singular, as
