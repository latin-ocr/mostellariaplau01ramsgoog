matrimonial and mercantile transactione, we might naturally suppose
that rhcomrhhre denoted ‘to sepamte,' ‘to set at variance,’ ‘to disturb,'
a meaning which would suit the passage before ns But it has been
objected that this interpretation is contrary to analogy‚-that although
in has frequently a negative force when compounded with adjectives
or participles, it never has this force when compounded with verbs
The old grammarians seem to have been in doubt as to the meaning
of inconciliare· thus Festus, or rather Paulus Diaconos, p. 107, ed
Mlill.,“lnconciltiuti‚ comparasti, commendasti, vel, ut antiqui, per dolum
decipere,” where it is supposed that ann'qui is intended to iudicate
Plautus. The passages in which the word occurs are the following:
1. Bac. 111. vi. 21, Ille, quod in se suri, adcuratum haberi qaod posset
mali Facere et in me inconciliare copias omnes meas. This is the reading
os the MSS. Camer. proposes jacere et, while R retains jaceret and
reads circumirent,- the former connects in nte with rhcoaa'lrare, the
latter wida scateret. It must be observed that the change proposed
by R is more violent than that introduced by Camen, indeed the
substitution offecere et for faceret cannot be regarded as a change
at all—according to either reading, ‘to set at variance with me,’ ‘to
’ disturb or throw into confusion,' ‘to stir up against me,' would be
a satisfactory meaning. 2. The line in the Mostellaria, now before
us. 3. Trin. Ι. ii. 99, Inconcr'lrirstin eum quimandalus erl tibi, Ille qui
mandavit, eum exturbasti ex aedibus? Edepol mandatum pulcre ei atratum
probel Here the sense given by Paul. Diae„ ‘decipere per dolum,' would
be more applicable. Goeller renders it, ‘malam remei et damnum
conciliare! Lastly, in the Persa, V. ii. 53, rhcona'lrizvit appears in the
printed editions, but the MSS. here are so corrupt that it is hard to
say whether the word racona'lriavil is indicated at all, and therefore
we can found nothing upon this passage* On the whole, if we
admit that thcnmirhre cannot signify to ‘disunite,' there is no reason
why it should not mean ‘to unite against,' ‘to stir up opposition,’
and so ‘to bring trouble upon any one,’ which will suit the passage
from the Mostellaria, and hence, ultimately, ‘to injure' or ‘deceive'
87. Obici argentum aa] If we adopt the reading given in our
teat the meaning will be ‘Order, I beseech you, the mouth of this
uncleau brute to be plngged (gagged) with silven' Os is here used
in its proper signification, but it is frequently employed hy Plautus
