dialogue is carried on either in the Iambic Trimeter Acat or in
Trochaic Tetrameter Cat; thu the lambic Tetrameter Cat, the
measure os which Aristophanes was so lond, is occasionally
employed, and also, although more sparingly, Trochaic and Iambic
Tetrameters Acatalectic. Moreover, Bacchiae and Cretic Tetra·
meters are so frequently introduced that they can be easily recog·
nised, and also, although with less certainty, the shorter species
and varieties oi verses belonging to ὼε whole oi the iour classes
specified.

But, in so tar as the Cantica are concerned, the case is altogether
different. Some of mese present little orno difficulty, in otbers all
is doubt, uncertainty, and confusion Metrical scholare have accord-
ingly here given iree rein to their imaginations, and, as might have
been anticipated, have arrived at the most discordant results. We
have excellent examples oi both kinds oi Cantica in me Mostellaria
The Canticum with which tbe Second Act commences can be
arranged in a satisfactory manner with little difficulty, and without
any important changes in ὼε text, and we shall take an opportunity
below oi reviewing it in detail. But the Canticum with which the
Fourth Act commences presente a different aspect. In B, me most
trustworthy oi our MSS, the monologue is divided into twenty-five
lines, oi· which four in succession (6, 7, 8, 9) are mutilated‚ ex·
hibiting lacunae to the extentos about two words in each, and v. 15
is evidently very corrupt Hermann (Lib. ΙΙ. cxxiii) distributas

the words into twenty-six lines, leaves many blanka, and introduces ἦ

several conjectural changes. Ritschl distributes the words into
twenty-seven lines, introducing a set oi changes different from those
oi Hermann, 3ηά agreeing with him as to the structure oi seven or
eight lines only. Weise distributes the words into thirty-seven lines,
differing totally from those oi Hermann and Ritschl. The remainder
oi me scene, in which a second speaker is introduced, is distributed
in B into sevcnteen lines, 3ηά by Hermann into the same number,
but his arrangement is totally different. Some critics had sup·
posed that they were irregular Cretica, but Hermann has convinced
himself that ffiey may be divided into Iambic Tetrameters Cat, but
admits that numerous alterations are necessary* Ritschl adopts
this theory and most oi Hermann’s emendations in so iar as the
first eleven lines are concerned, but the remainder he supposes to
consist oi a compound measure, made up oi an Iambic Dimeter
