viii PROLEGOMENA.

a very pale brown, while the ink oi others is unusually black. Again

. in the same play, portioris of several pages have been left blank, aud
as these blanks do not indicate any gap in the sense, and occur be·
fore a change in the hand, it seems reasonable to inser tlrat different
scribes had different portions of the play allotted to them, without
any nice calculation as to the accurate union of the portioris.

The MS. has been ruled throughout, generally with some blunt·
pointed instrument which marked the vellum' without ruffling the
surlace. The lines however are in many cases irregular, being
closer to each other in some parts of the same page than in others,
while the number of lines in different pages varies much, the general
number however contained in one page being fifty-oue or fifty-two.
In some cases, e. g. in portions oi the Rudenr, the pages are written
in double columns. Irregular as is the execution ο1 the work, the
writing is notwithstanding legible throughout, the contractione are
few and for the most part simple.

As to the divisiones the words, the statement ol Ritschl, “Verborum
distinctio aut nulla estant prava,'’ is not borne out, at least as far as
the Marullarris is concerned, as in this play the words are sor the
most part correctly divided in the MS. There is no division into
acts; but in some plays the different scenes are distinguished, a space
being leit at the end of each in which are inserted in red ink the
names of the persons who take part in the following scene. In like
manner, the changes ol person in the dialogne are caresully indicated
by the insertion oi the speaker’s name in red ink, either at the be·
ginning oi the line or in aspace left ior the purpose in the middle
os the line as the case may be· This however does not apply to all
the plays, in some of which great irregularity prevails. In the Persa,
for example, although spaces have been lert marking the divisione
of the scenes, the names of the characters have been inserted in five
or six cases only, while, although spaces are leit to indicate the
transition from one speaker to another in the dialogus, the names
have in no case been inserted In all probability the names of the
characters were added after the plays were transcribed, and by a
different hand ; a view which derives confinnation from the fact that
while in some plays they are written in red ink, in others, e. g. the
curcula, Carrio, Epidicus, in black, which in some cases has been

written or painted over with red ; in some cases, eg. conspicuously
in the Persa, the blanks bave never been filled up at all, and while
Roman characters are generally employed in some plays, Greek
characters have been made use ol in others.
