pacm, nil etiam scia, ‘I will not shrink from my engagement, and (yet ,

with reference to) that which at this present moment l know mill as·
suredly come to pass, 1 do not know at this present moment (as yet)
how l shall bring it about' Such seems to be the meaning of this
difficult passage. The first ol the two lines appears under a different
form in almost every different edition. We have inserted quod, with·
out which the line cannot be scanned, but in other respects have
adhered to the best MSS, which do not exhibit any variation.

a. ‘Even now’ with a negative, ‘as yet,’ ‘up to this time ;' Persi„
iii. 48, Numquam edepol quoiquam ettam utendam dedi, ‘never as yet’
‘never up to this time have I' διας ΙΙ. ii. 49, Sophoclidisca says to
the boy Paegnium, Tu quidem haud elram es octaginta ponda ‘not yet do
you weigh six stones ;' IV. iv. 4, Toxilus having asked Dordalus if he
had not been struck by the wisdom displayed by the maiden as soon
as she opened her mouth, the leno replies coolly, Haud patui ettam
in prima verba perspicere rapieutriim, ‘l have not been able as yet, on
hearing the first word she uttered, clearly to discem her wisdom.¹
Sometimes, to make the meaning more clear and emphatic, adhuc is
added: thus Amph. 1. i. 92, Numquam ettam quicquam adhuc verborum
est prolocutus perperam, ‘not one word even now (as yet) up to the
present moment has he uttered contrary to truth’

3. ‘Even now,' implying that an action is continued without inter-
ruption. This is distinctly expressed in Amph. ll. i. 21, Regesne,
improbe, etr'am qui ludas sacis med ‘you who are even now (still)
making garne ol me,’ ‘continuing to make gaure os me ;' in 1. i. 213,
Mercury says to Sosia, Ar nuntr'ris elram, ‘you are lying even now,’
‘you are continuing to tell lalsehoods,’ having previously said campa-
sa'tis mendaciis adaenzitz',· As. V. ii. 73, Aletrium cubat mulus Surge,
amatim, i domum, ‘but that old cuckoo is even now (still) roosting
there,' ‘is continuing to roost there ;' Cas.ll.vi16,Ium dudum,
hercle, fabular. C. Pol tu patiamurque elram sacis, ‘1 have been
prating here ever so long.' ‘There’s no mistake about that, and you
are doing so even now,' ‘ you are continuing to prate ;’ Bac. IV. iv.
93, M. Loquere porro. C. Adscribe dum. M. Eiram loquere, where
aleam loquere is the same as loquere porra, ‘go on‚' ‘continue' Other
examples os ettam in this sense may be sound in Amph. Ι. i. ²²53 As
11. ii. 61; Capi. ΙΙΙ. iv. 243 Cure. l. iii. 403 Men. IV. iii. 23, V. i10;
Mero. lV. iv. 23 ; Mil. ΙΙΙ. i. 453 Pers. V. ii. 46 ; Trin. ΙΙ. ἰν. 171.

Etiam implies addition in such combinations as the following:
Mil. V. 8, Cario says to his master, Iam in hommem r'nualad to which

tsu Periplectomenes replieS, Ima, eitam prius verberetur fustibus, ‘no, not

’κ
