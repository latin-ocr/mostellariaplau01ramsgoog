100 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

⁰ omnam perlem Herculi* polluceom. We find also the participle iu
Rud. ΙΙ. iv. ιι, Non ego surr polluelu pago. Polirl ul me opslr‘neos
aarum) which must mean, ‘Hande offl Iam no tit bit for the
humphins of the parish,' ie. ‘I am meat for your mastere' The
application of this word in Cure. 1. iii. 37, Turl meone Venerem vitupe-
ros? Quod quidem melei polluente or‘rgri senor sermonen reret! which

must eignify ‘a slave who has been entertained with a liberal allow·
auce of stripesz’ for the verb pollucere signifying ‘to offer in metrice:
and the custom being to present the most choice objecta of each
kind to the gods, the derivatives of pollucere frequently convey the
notion of sumptuousnees, magnificence, nusparing liberality; thus
we find in Macrob. S. II.13,pollucibllls cena in the sense of a
sumptuoue banquet, aud in the passage before us opsonole pollucibiliter
mean, ‘make your market without stinting yourself' So also we
have seen above, in the passage quoted from Cassius Hemina,
polluctum used in reference ιο abanquet prepared in honour of the
. gods without regard to price; and Macroh S. 11. ra mentions
specially a polluctum Hercules· in the Rud. V. iii 63 we read,
Spectolores, vor quoque od cerrum uocem, Ni daturus rell sehr, neque se'l
que'equam pollucti dorni, i. e. ‘anything duinty3' and finally, in Stich
V. iv. 6, lu'ru quidem Hodie polluctura, proeler nor, riam daton ricmiri,
ie. ‘good cheer.' The modification in meaning which pollucere and
its derivatives assumed in the later writers may be seen by referring
ιο the Lexicons. The etymology is uncertain, but it bas been

conjectured with some plausibility that it is connected with prrn'ct'o,

which also is a sacrificial word. See Priscian IX. p. 874, and

quotation from the Colax of Naevius. See also Bentley's Terence,

’ ed. Volbehr, p. xxvi.
