It must not be supposed that these various forms of torture were
by any means conlined to male slaves, sor women also seem to have
been treated by bmtal masters with the same merciless severity.

This will appear lrom the terms in which Callicles addresses his
ancillae in Tmc. IV. iii 1 seqq, and the cruelty ol Roman ladies

to their attendants has been sorcibly depicted by Juvenal in his sixth
Satire. There is a curious passage in Terence, Adel. V. iii. tio, where
Demea decimes that he will carry off to the country the beautiful
Psaltria, who had iascinated his son, and compel her to perform the
labours of a rustic drudge: M. Modo foculo ul allam serves. D. Ego
elme omno .· Atque t'llr'soor'lloe plenu, Jicmv‘, oc pollina, Coquendo sil
saxo el molendo: practer laec Meridie ipso saccom ul rapulam conligat:
Tam excoctum reddam alque elram quom carbo esl,· cf. Merc. 11. iii 78.
Although tortured in avast variety oi ways, slaves were rarely put
to death by their masters, because such vengeance would hare
entalled the loss ol valuable property. Crucihxion however is ire-
quently spoken os, and is used as a threat‚ or a taunt, or a jest:

D. Drlclr'. P. Quid merolus? D. Crucem ,· Mil. H. iv. 19, Noli

oculi fodiri.

ln Mil. 11.· rv 6 there rs an allusion to the practice ol making
the criminal carry the crosa or gibbet to which he was to be nailed
through the streets to the spot outside the walls where the execution
took place: Credo ego r'sloc exemplo libi esse curidum actutum extra
portam,† Disponis manthos patibulum quom habebam on which a frag·
ment from the lost play ol the Carbonariass serves as a commentary,
Polibulumserolper urbem dende affigamur) cruci.
