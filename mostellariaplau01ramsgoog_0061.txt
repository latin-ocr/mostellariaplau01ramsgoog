have anticipated from the close, natural relation which subsists be·
tween these two lablal mutes, in virtue of which they are constantly
interchanged, not only in cognate languages but in different dialects
of the same langrmge, and even in different parts oi the same word
in the same dialect, as, ior instance, in nudo, nuptia· scribo, scripse}
lator, Iaprren and the like. The only Latin words which end inb
are the prepositions ab, ob, sut. The connection ol two of these
with dod and ind is obvious, and although no trustworthy examples
ol ap, op, or sup are supplied by inscriptions, it is certain that they
frequently took this sound in composition when prefixed to words
commencing with s or t.

Thus Quintil. 1. Ο. 1. vii. 7: “Quaeri solet, in scribendo ·

praepositiones, sonum, quem iunctae efficiunt, an, quem separatae,
observare conveniat; ut quum dico obicienti, secundam enim Β
literam ratio poscit, aures magis audiunt Ρ.”

As might have been expected, in the earlier sorms os the language
the ear exercised greater influence than etymological considerations,
and we find in the inscriptions which we have enumerated above,
ap, op, and step, sor ab, od, sub, when these prepositions are com-
pounded with words beginning with r or t Thus APSOLVTVS
[12th OPSIDES [1], OPSlGNETVR [12], OPTINENT [17],
OPTINEBIT [la 14, 16 briJ, OPTENVI [7], SVPSIGNET,
SVPSIGNENT, SVPSIGNATO, SVPSIG(netur), SVPSIGNA-
TVM, SVPSIAVO [14]. These insmnces are not very nmnerous,
but they are all in the same direction, and we find no example of
any of these prepositions retaining its proper shape before s or t
until we reach lo, ΒΩ. 49, which contains ABSOLVITO thrice;
and 20, B.C. 45, which has OPTEMPERETVR, and therefore we
may leel justified in assmning that the practice prevailed during the
age ol Plautus andlong afterwards. We may saiely extend the rule
to those cases in which the preposition abs enters into composition,
for we find in inscriptions oi a comparatively late date such forms
as APSTINERE, APSTINENTI, APsTVL1T, APSTVLERIT,
APSENS, APSENTI.

Numerous passages are to be found in the old grammarians
bearing upon the relation subsisting between ds, ps, and the Greek
ψ, the sound of the latter not being accurately represented by either
ol the two tormen* so that Claudius, among other grammatical

* Thus Priscian, p, 557, “multo molliorem et volubilior-em sonum

habet ψ quam ps vel bs . . . sicut ergo ψ melius sonat (quam ps vel bs)
sic x etiarn quarn gs vel cs.- et x quidem assumpsimus, ψ autern non.”
