16. gnarures. . . tuncrum] We cannot draw any distinction as
to meaning between gnarus and gnaruris. The latter occurs again
in Poen. Prol. 47, Ad argummtum nunc aririsatim uolo Remigrare,
aeque ut mecum sr'trs gnarures, but it is not found elsewhere until we
come down to Amobius and Ausonius. Forcellini marks the pen-
ultimate long, gnarures. The versification in the passage before us

is so uncertain that it cannot be employed in evidence, while in the .

line from the Poenulus, which is an lambio Trimeter, the penultimate
must be short ; and so also in huson. Epp. XXII. 19, Nan cultor
instans narr arator gnarures, which line also is an lambic TrImeter.
The young scholar will remark the accusative after gnarures govemed,
we must suppose, by the verb implied in the adjective.

18. examussim] i. e. ‘true to rule and plummet.’ While, strictly,
regula signifies ‘a straight rule,’ norma ‘two straight rules j0ined at
right angles,’ that is, ‘a square,’ pcrpmdr‘culum ‘a plumbline,' lr'bella
‘the combination of a rule and plummet' and rubrica ‘the challred
cord’ used by masona, amussis would seem to denote a carpenter's or
mason’s ‘level’ that is, an instrument used to ascertain that a surface
is perfectly horizontal This at least seems to be the meaning of
Vana, as quoted by Nonius (s. v. Examursr'm p. 9), amursrir' est aequa-
men levamentum, r'd est apud fabros tabula quaedam qua utuntur ad saxa
caagmartata; and of Paul. Diac. (sv, p. ό, ed. Muli), who explains it
as regula ad quam alr’qur'd exaequatur, although, in all probability, the
. whole of the above words were employed indifferently when technical
langue-ge was not required* See huson. Eidyll. XVI. 11, where we
have the nominative amrussr's. Ad amussim, or, in one word, Adamas:
sam, is found in Varro R. R. ΙΙ. 1, Si r'nquam, mamam aaa est ut sr't
adamussim, which means, if the number given is not ‘precisely
exact ;' and in Aul (iell. 1. 4, XX. 1, Macrob. S. 1. 4, it means in like
manner, ‘to anicety‚ exactly! Examursim is found again in Plaut.
Amph. ll. ii. 213, Nassa edepol, si haec uera loquatur, exammsz'm est
optuma, i. e. ‘is absolutely perfect ;' and Men. Prol. 50, Vt banc rem
uobis exammsr'm disputem, ie. ‘with perfect accuracy and distinctness ;’
and reappears later in Apuleius. ln Mil ΙΙΙ. i. 38 we have amus·
st'tata, the participle of a verb amussim, Inest in troc emussitata sua
sibi vigenna unciales, i. e. ‘a liberal disposition squared and balanced
according to the nicest rule of right!

²5· tegulas imbutasque] Immex is probably the gutter or open

* Sisenna, quoted by Charis. p. 178, males amussis an instrument for
determining that a wall is built perpendicularly.
