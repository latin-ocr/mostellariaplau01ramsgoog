ORTHOGRAPHY. xxxiii

But we may go further, and lay it down as a general rule, that down
to ΒΩ. roo, or even later, the combination vu (uu) was rurknowu,
whether the first v had the force ol a vowel or of a consonant.
Thus not only did the ancients write volnus, wlgus, cervos, seruos,
but also motum, compascuos, aquom, wem, and the like invariably, and
Ι know not why Ritschl and others should have made an exception
and written tuus and suus instead ol tuor, stuc* Thus MORTVOS

SVOS ter [12], ΟΟΜῈΙΝΟΝΤ, FLOVIOM, FLOVIVM reptes,
FLOVIO quaten FLOVI, INIQVOM, IOVENTIO‚ RlVOM

There are two words which, during the period of the Republic‚
so far as our evidence extends, were invariably written with 0,
although e afterwards prevailed. These are Vester, and vortat with
its derivatives and compounds: thus vosTRnE, vosuRVM,
VOSTRA [15]‚ ARVORSVM [10], VORSVS, ADVORSVS,
ADVORSVM [11], AVORSVM bis, ADVORSVS‚ ADVOR-
SARIVM, ARVORSARIO ter [12], CONTROVORSIEIS,
CONTROVORSIAS, CONTROVOSIAS‚ SVRSVMVORSVM,
SVRSVORSVM, SVSO VORSVM [12], ADVORTIT [15],
ADVORSVS [18 bis}

There was a tradition in the time of Quintilian that the change
from o to e in verme, verno, and such like words, was first intro·
duced by Scipio Africanus: “Quid dicam nonies et nonu, ceteraque
ad eundem modum, quae primo Scipio Africanus in E literam
secundm vertisse dicitur?” But ifwe can put saith in the gram-
marians, many words in addition to the above were written with o,

in the text the spelling sanctioned by Ritschl, Fleckeisen, and the Plautine
entier, and have written unifo rurs, trau, mon, 11111111,311·, notwith-
standing the opinion here expr .-En.]

†VERSVS occurs in n. 603, an inscription whlchnprofw to belong
to ΒΩ. 58, but which is attended with so many susp¹c¹01¹³ urcumstances
that tt cannot he regarded as possessinfg any authority.
