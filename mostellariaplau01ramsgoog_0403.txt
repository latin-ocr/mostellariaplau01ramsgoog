260 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

The occupatiori itsels was called Carnuficr'rra, Cist. ll i. ¹3 and
those who practised it were said carnuficr'nam facere, CaptL ii. eq,
equivalent to which is sacere quaestum carcerarium, o. 26. The
employment was by no means honourable nor popular, and henoe
no term ol vituperation is more common than carrusex.

The word Zorartr' is found in the Dramatr's Personae and stage
directions ol some plays, but does not occur in the textos any
classical author. Aulus Gellius (N. A. tt 3) tells us that, aster the
departure ol Hannibal from Italy, the Romans refused to acknow-
ledge the Bruttii as socri, or to enrol them as soldiers, but employed
them to discharge servile dubes tor provincial govemors—“ Itaque
hi sequebantur magistratus, tamquam in scenicis fabulis qui dice·
bantur torarri} et quos erant iussi vinciebant et verberabant.”

Sometimes fantastic terma are used: thus True. IV. iii. 8, Ness' si
ad umbracula uos uoltis edaci or'ros, where the te‘ntr'nnacult m'rr' are
the floggers who make the seourge sing or whistle about the ears ol
the sufferers: in like manner Pseud. I. iii 98, lamas e'nde' arcessam
duos cum hattonabules. Eadem duo greges os'rgarum riade ulmearam ad·
egero,· with which compare Ruu.111.v. 25, Ι). Ehem! optume edepol,
ecaem clavator morast. L. Illud quidem edepol amoenam est «κυνῶπα,-
while in Pers. 11. iii. ra we have another expression for the sound
of the lash upon the flesh, De'u quod berse err't die uno apsolaam, tax tax
tergo oreo err't.

We may conclude by quoting some lines lrom As. ΙΙΙ. ii. 1, which
give a sort ot summary of the tortures inflicted upon slaves3 Perfidiae
laudes gratiasque habemus merim magnas, Quom nastris sareptanam,
doles, astutusque, Scapularum confidentem, verace ulmorum sretr', Qui
advorsum sternata, lamebas, crucesque, compedesque Neruas, catenas,
carceres, numellas, pedicas, boras, Indoctoresque acerrimos, gnarosque
rastri tergi, Qus saepe arete r'a nostras scapulas amentes samareae,-
and with these we may compare Men. V. vi. 8, Recordemr id, qui
nr‘hils' sunt, quid r'r's preti Detur ab suis tzers’s, egnavit, mprobis Viris:
uerbera, compedes, malae, magna Lassae, sames, srr‘gus darum, Haec
pretia sant egermorae. Afew ol the words given above may require
explanation, in addition to what has been said already.

Lamim were thin platos ol metat raised to a red beat and applied
to the fiesh: they are spoken of by Lucretius, ΙΙΙ. 1029, Verbera, car-
nufiees, robur, pix, lamr'em, taedam by Cicera, ln Verr. Act. ll. ν. 63,
Quidquam egnes ardentesque lareshae ceterique eructatus adrcoeebaamre

and by Horace, Epp. l. xv. 36, Scilicet ut ventres lamna candente ue
potum Diceret urendos corrector Bestr'us.
