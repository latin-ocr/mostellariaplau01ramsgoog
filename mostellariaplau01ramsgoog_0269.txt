‘more unfortunate: Men. 111. i. 23 sceleshisumum, ‘most wretched:
Cas. 111. v. 343 me c'rssele'cem et scelestam, Cist. lV. ii. 17 3 cf. Rud
IV. iv. 123; mihi scelesto, Rud. 11. vi. 18 ; and advantage is
sometimes taken of the double meaning, as in As, 11. iv. 69, Age,
thcpudice, Sceleste. L. Non audes mihi sceleste sudums're. There is a
close analogy between the use of scelestus and the English adjective
wretched, which is ambiguam, since it may be applied to a man who
is simply unhappy, or to a man in an unhappy position from guilt.
So also ‘you wretch' and ‘he is a wretch' are vituperative, while both
may be employed playfully; not so, however, ‘wretch that I aml’
So we talk of wretched wcather, a wretched harvest, a wretched year
sarsarmers, and the like.

32. eth· Morem praecepere se'c geras] Morem gerere alebui denotes
that a person suits or accommodates his or her ways and wishes to
those of another, and hence signities generally, ‘to comply with: ‘to

plied to one who indulges his own inclinatione, e. g. Amph. Prot. 131,
Pater nunc cistas seeo amissa marem gerit. From the combination
nearent gerere are formed the· adjective morigeras and the verb mort-
gera or morigeram· so below, ΙΙ. 1. 51, Morigerae tihi crsisius amhae,-
and in Cist. 1. iii. 27, Ea dcem suum obsit, sacta morigera est asra,
