244 PLAVTI MOSTELLan. '

One or two phrases connected with money and money payments l
require some explanation. '

(a) Commodus denotes that a sum mentioned is ‘of full weight;'
Rud. V. ii. 31, Talentum argenti commodum magnum riserat in murtena,-

and As. III. iii. 135, Qus‘d ego aaut exoptem amplius, mii illud quoiam⁴

r'oopr'a est, Vige'ntr' argenti comorodar mehor buras quas dem matri? and
Illerc. 11. iii. ror, where the father and son are bidding ln opposition,
each pretending to be the agent of a friend, D. anm none amiram.-
'addam sex melros. C. Septem mr'hr' (Numquam edepol me mmet hadre)
commodet posct‘t, poter.

Modicus seems to be employed ln the same sense, Pseud IV. n'i. ·
130, B. Perdeiiit me. S. At me argenti modicas mulctavit meires.

(b) Probatus again indicates that the purity of the metal iu the
coin or bullion had been tested; thus Pers. IV. vi. r, Proboti hir
argenti ment sexaginta mimae, with which compare 111. iii. 33.

(c) When Labrax says, Rud. III. iv. 21, Tu, senex, si e'stas aereos,
huc amito argento est opas, the phrase is probably equivalent to ‘hard
cash τ’ the explanatione given by the older commentators are fancifuh
not to say ridiculous,

(d) Among the smaller denominatione the Tmobolum is frequently
mentioned, generally indefinitely for a very small sum, as in Rud. V.
ii. 43,<when Gripus is asired how much he demands for giving the
information sought, he replies, Talentum teregnum, non potest metatum
boire abesse, ‘a taient, not a farthing less ;’ and lower down, o. 67,
Non etti ego hodie debeo trtobolum, ‘I don’t owe him a sarthingz’ see
also Bac. 11. iii. 26, Poen. IV. ii. 46, Rud. 1v. iii. 100, V. iii. 11: in
like manner Poen. 1. ii. 168, Non ego honre trioboli sum, m'se' ego itti
mastigiae Extorto ocrdos atque denter, ‘I am a man not worth a
sarthing if' &c.; and the same expression recurs, 11. 17.

(e) De'obolorr's, an adjective, is found ,in Poen. Ι. ii. 58, and Frag.
Cistell. ap. Varr. L. L. VIII. 64, ed. Mitll. See also Paul Diae.

, ΙΙ. Pto'lr'ppus s. Nemus Phr'leitpeus. The coinage of Athens and of
the rest of Greece may he said to have consIsted os silver and copper
exclusively up to 350 hc, for although gold was occasionally ntiuted
before that period, it was issued in very small quantities, and the
circtdation was necessarily extremely limited. About the time however
indIeated above, Philip 1·1 of Macedon, the father os Alexander the
Great, obtained such large supplies of gold from the miues os Thrace
that during the remainder of his life he struck enormous numbers of

gold coins, thch were speedily dispersed all over the world. These ·
