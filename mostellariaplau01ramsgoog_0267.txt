124 PLhVTl MOSTELLARIA.

Most. ΙΙΙ. Ι. ²3 (19), Mclw nc technae meac perpetua perierint, ‘I am
afraid that my schemes have been and will be upset one after another
without a pause 3’ and so perpetua perire signifies the same as pcri're
in perpetuant modurn, ‘to go to destruction headlong;' Pers. ΙΙ. iv. 10,
Adel. 11. iv. ι9, Eun. V. iii. 13. The phrase in perpetuam is some-
times equivalent to ‘always' and may be used with reference to the
period of a whole life: Heaut. IV. v. 333 Cic. Cat. 1. 123 Liv. Vll.
37. The verb perpetuare occurs once in Plautus, Pseud. I. iii. 72,
Nan est riccius quc'sqtcant ancalar m'si qai pcrpclical dala, ‘unless one
who males presents uninterruptedly,’ and is found in Cicero also.
For other examples of perpetuus and perpetuo, see Amph. J'rol. ⁶3
Poen. Ι. ii. 82 ; Pers. III. i. a ; Eun. V. iv. 113 Adel. V. ix. 153

⁴ And. 111. ili. 323 Adel. IV. i. 6; Hec. ΙΙΙ. iii. 46.

64. Cor dolel] ie. ‘my heart aches‚' from which is formed the
substantive cordolium, ‘the beart-ache,' found twice in Plautus ; Cist.
1. ἰ 67, Poen. I. ii. 8⁶3 and revived by Apuleius Met IX. ι9ο. lt
has been adopted into Italian as cardaglia.

68. Discpulcnac alcis wan] ie. ‘l was a pattem (or model) to
others' The original unsyncopated form ol the word is here pre·
served in the Palatine MSS. In this passage dciapulcnae is equiva-
lent to exempla, ‘I was a model from which others might leam
their duty,' but it assumes many shades of meaning, which may
however be easily connected with each other. Thus in As. 1. iii.
49, cadcn discplcna utimur means, ‘we follow the same system ,·'
in Cas. 111. v. 24, Atticam disciplinam, ‘the laws and usages of
Athens;' and in a. 28, Malacam malam discplinam, ‘the evil ex-
ample or customs of bad women 3’ in Cist. 1. i. 18, dc'sccplina is ‘the
ways and rules of a family ;' in Bac. 1. ii. 27, tua disciplina is exactly
represented by ‘your discipline,' via, that of a teacher towards a
pupil, aud so Ill. iii. 173 in Mil. II. ii. 30, parci disciplinans, ‘lether
school herself ;' in Mete. l. 6, laec diciplina, ‘this fashion or custom ;'
in Truc. Ι. i. 30, ila est disciplina, ‘thus are matters ordered ;' in
I. ii. 29, ca cst disciplina, ‘so was I trained to be!

- Parsimonia et darana diiapulcnae alc'is ecam] Dricc'pulcnac may be
either the genitive after parsimonia and durilia, signifying ‘training,’
in which case the construction will be cram exempla cliii, or the
dative, eran dcicipulcnac aliis, i. e. ‘l was a lesson to others!

Ι. iii. 9. Periere daec oppido aedes] This is the reading of B, which
has hcc, and was adopted by Camerarius; the rest of the MSS. have
liae. There can be no doubt however that laec was used occa-
sionally hythe older writers as the feminine norn. pl, and it is -
