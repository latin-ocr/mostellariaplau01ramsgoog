xiv PROLEGOMENA.

0. The Codex ater ol Camerarius, frequently designated since
the dme ol Pareus, as the Codex Demrtalro.

On the death of Camerarius this MS. was purchased, along with
the Velm Codex, and deposited in the Palatine Library; from thence
it was transferred to the Vatican3 in1797 it was carried to Paris,
and in 1815 restored to the Library at Heidelberg, where it now
remarns.

It belongs to the twellth century, and iswritteu on 238 leaves ol
parchment in quarto. It originally contained the whole twenty plays,
but the first eight have been torn off, and the last twelve alone remain.
It was executed by various hands, and the writing is by no means
elegant The division into words is more corrupt than in B ; there
is no separation into lines except in a lew cases in the Senarians.
The names ol the characters are generally inserted both at the com·

meucement oi the scenes and in the changes in the dialogue, and ³

when omitted a space is muaHy left blank ior their insertion.
The arrangement ol the plays is the same as in B.

D. The Codex vastam, numbered 3870.
This has been proved to be the identical MS. brought to Italy in

1429 by Nicolas of Treves from Germany, and delivered to Cardinel ’

Orsini* concerning which we have spoken at length above.

It contains, in 308 sheets of parchment, the Amphitruo, Arahario,
Aulularia, about one-hall of the Captivi, and the twelve last plays
entire.

lt bears a very close resemblance to C, both in age, shape, writing,
and perverse distribution os the metrical lines, but was written uni·
sormly hya single hand, and is somewhat less faulty in the division
ol the words.

lt. Tm Codex Lapn'ensir, belonging to the Bibliotheca Senatoria.
It belongs to the lourteenth century, is written beautifully on 314 sheets
ol parchment in lolio, and contains the whole twenty plays. It is
sometimes designated as the Codex Sarclanus, in consequence ol
having, during a portion of the sixteenth century, been in the pos-
session ol Hieronymus Surita, ol Saragossa Itis regarded by R. as
presenting the interpolated text under its best form.

Lastly, we may mention z, the Editio Praiacepr, edited by George
Merula, and printed at Venice in ¹47²· ’

[Hence called hy R. ‘Ursinianurn.’-Eb.] .
