II.-THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF PLAUTUS.

Every one who is familiar with the textos Plautus, as presented
in the printed copies, must be struck by the differences which it
exhibita in orthography. Not only does he detect these discrepancies
in the more important editions, when compared with each other, but
he olien finds the same word appear under a different form in the
same edition, in the same play, and even in lines almost consecutive.
Nor will he be able to discover any tired principle by which editors
have been guided They seem to have followed at one time one
guide, at another time another, and not unfrequently to have partially
adopted some system founded upon their own individual views os
grammar and etymology. This is most perplexing to ayoung scholar.
lt seriously embarrasses and retards his progress, and the labour
necessary to master the difficulties, when unattended by any sure
result, proves most irlrsome‚ because his memory is severely taslred
without the conviction that his mind has been beneficially exercised.
It is clearly desirable to put an end to this state ol things. More
than one method may be pursued.

1. We may endeavour to restore the orthography ol the Latin
language as it existed during the third century B.C.‚ and to reproduce
the lines ol Plautus exactly as we may suppose them to have pro·
ceeded lrom the pen os the author. Every one acquainted with the
subject will at once admit that this is simply impossible; that we
have no means at our disposal which would enable us to accomplish
such an object

2. We may content ourselves with adopting what may be called
the standard orthography ol Latin, which, although varying slightly
according to the views of scholars upon particular points, is sub
stantially the same in all the leading editions ol the classice, and was
probably sormally adjusted during the first century ol the Empire.
This is perhaps the most simple plan, and is open to sever objections.
The leamer is not discouraged by encountering unnecessary obstacles,
and he can investigate the questions connected with the early history
and orthography os the language when he has advanced larther in
his studies. Moreover‚ this is the course which we here ourselves
have adopted with regard to our own Shakespeare.

3. There is however yet another path open, a sort ol uriz medula,

anri this is the one which 1 leel inclined to follow. lt can be proved
