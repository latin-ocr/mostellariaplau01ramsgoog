neque mulieres Romanae per Herculem deiurant, neque viri per
Castorem. Sed cur illae non iuraverint Herculem, obscuram non
est. Nam Herculaneo sacrificio abstinent Cur autem viri Castorem t
iurantes non appellaverint, non facile dictu est. Nusquam igitur
scriptum invenire est apud idoneos quidem scriptores, aut mehercule
feminam dicere, aut mecastor virum. Aedepol autem, qnod iusiurandum

per Pollucem est, et viro et feminae commune est Sed M. Varro
asseverat antiquissimos viros neque per Castorem neque per Pollucem
deiurare solitos3 sed id iusiurandum fuisse tantum feminarum ex
initiis Eleusiniis acceptum: paulatim tamen, inscitia antiquitatis,
viros dicere aedepol cepisse ; factumque esse ita dicendi morem: sed '
mecastor a viro dici, in nullo vetere scripto inveniri.”

Tbls doctrine bas been called in question by scholars, and the

⁵ following passages have been quoted to prove that men did swear
by Castor, and women by Hercules, but they will be found to present
no real difficulty. We must bear in mind the circumstance, to which
we have already adverted in the Prolegomena, that the distribution
of the dialogus among tbe different characters rests in many cases
solely upon the discretion of the mediaeval transcriber or modern r
editor, for it appears certain that in the MS. which was the archetype ,
of those now existing, the change from one speaker to another was
indicated merely by a blank space, the name of the speaker not
having been inserted. Indeed, in the best existing MS. of Plautus,
the Vetus Codex of Camerarius, the space for the names is left blank
in some of the plays. This being premised, we may proeeed
to examine the examples which have been adduced in opposition to
the clearly expressed and positive assertion of Varro.

In As. V. ii. the persons on the stage are Artemona, the wife of
Demaenetus, Demaenetus himself, his son Argyrippus, Philenium,
and a parasite. Artemona and the parasite, unseen by the rest,
overhear the conversation of the father, the son, and Philenium; at
o. 44 the text of the Vulgate is as follows, ΡΗ. Dic, amabo, aer foetet
onim uxeres tuae? D. Nauteam Bibere malem, si necessum est, quam
ellam oscularier. Ans. Illiser ecastor es. Pe. Mecastor dignus est:
but it would bc more appropriate to put the words Miser erasto es
into the mouth of Philenium, and to make the observation Mecastor
dignus es proceed from the angry and insulted wile instead of from
the parasite.

The next example is to be found in the same scene, a 80,
D. Totus perri! A. Quid tandem? anema foeta ne uxorei· roae?
D. Murrlrom olet. A. Iam subripuisti pallam quam scorto dores)
