meet the eye in a written conversation. Again, the speaker may
affirm what has been said, but with a qualification; this qualification
may be such as to strengthen the remark previously made, or it may
call in question the accuracy of a portion of the remark, aod the
qualification may in certain cases be so important as to amount to
a contradiction.

The force of quala, when explanatory, may generally be rendered
' by one or other of the English expressions ‘well then‚' ‘why, l tell
you‚’ ‘but‚' ‘nay‚' ‘nay, for that matter‚' but the full force would in
many cases be conveyed by the tone or gestures of the speaker. It
will be seen from some of the quotations that quin and ιἠιο are
occasionally equivalent.

What we have said will be more easily understood from the
following examples.

1. Quin equivalent to cur non in a simple direct interrogation
followed by the indicative: Most. Ι. iii ra, Qur'n lu te exornas ntorr’-
bus leptllr's quom leprlla fota es? Trin. 111. iii. 73, Quid nunc slas) qur'n
te hinc amoves e! le nroves? Mete· 1. 77, 78, Eho tu, eho tu, qur'n cavisti,
ne eam urilcret, verbero? Ouzia, sceleste, apstrudebae ne ram conspiceret
pater? The last example is specially remarkable because it is said
to be the only passage in Plautus in which queit, in the sense of cur
non, is followed by a past tense.

Sometimes the question is put in an indignant tone3 e. g. Trio. Ι.
ii. 81, (ὶηίη eum restituis? Quin ad frugem corrigas? or denotes im·
patience, as Men. lv, ii. 75, Quid id est? quid laces? quin dicis quid
sit? or conveys a remonstrance or entreaty, Pers. III. i. 69, Quin lu
me ducis, se* quo ducturus, paler? Vel lu me vende, aelfare quod tibi
lubet,· and so Men. V. vii. ιι, Eprilamm‘enses, subvenite, cibes! quin
me mr'ttr'tr's?

Quin is frequently followed by the imperative, and in this case the
expression may always be regarded as elliptical ; thus blost. l. iii. 16,
Quin me aspice el contempla, is equivalent to dspr'cc el contempla nce, qur'n
ospr'cisr‘ i. e. ‘look at me, why don’t you lookl' and so again, v. 30,
Quin mone, quaeso, ιη’ quid erro . . Alfene, quaeso, quin mones? i. e.
‘advise me, l beg, why don't youl’ In ΙΙΙ. ἰ. 45 (41) we have a
good example, in the same line, of quin in a direct interrogation, and
also followed by the imperative; D. Quin fu ritas mr'tfr's trr'cas?
z Qum quid vis cedo. Quin followed by tbe imperative may imply
encouragement3 thus Adel. IV. ii. 4, C. Perii! S. Qur'n fu αηίηιο
dono es, i. e. ‘cheer up, ean't youl' and in the previous scene, rt ιγ,
Quin otiosas es, ‘be easy, can't youl' There is an ellipse of the
