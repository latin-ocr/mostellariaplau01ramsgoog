ORTHOGRAPHV. xxxi

plural of masculine and feminine nouus of the third declension,
have the terminations in eir and ir as well as er.

Thus ve have the nominatives CEIVEIS in 12, FINEIS twice
in 13, and IOVDICIS in 12, FINIS in ls; the accusatives

smus [labn‚1squrtrqu1'es], antivarum pay, ounsrs ps,

16 br's], CALLEIS [14], DECEMBREIS [16 sextis} CIVEIS [18
br'sJ, ALPEIS [19 bir], and LITIS [12], SEXTILIS [ls]‚ OMNIS
[12 ter], OCTOBRIS [14]‚ MVNICIPIS [2021] Itis reasonable
to suppose that eis vas the original form, and that the two forms in es
andis arose from some dropping out one vowel and some the other.

In some of the oldest MSS. of the Latin classica, the Medicean
Virgil for example, the form iu is, especially in accusatives, is much
more common than that in es, although the latter is by no means ex·
cluded Hence a conclusion has been drawn that the form in is is the
more ancient, and therefore ought to be introduced in all cases into
the textos Plautus in preference to es, at all events in accusatives.

But setting aside the consideration that the practice of the fifth
century after Christ cannot be accepted as any evidence of the
practice of the second or third century before Christ, we can prove
that the termination in er was in use from the earliest period to
which our knowledge extends, and appears even before eir: thus
ne have OPSIDES, acc. [1]; VIRTVTES, acc. [513 VIRTVTES,
acc. [713 HOMINES, nom, MVLIERES, nom. [1013 RE·
CVPERATORES, acc. [11] ; while we baveno trace of ir in the
nominative or accusative until ve come down to 11 and 12; we
have given all the examples of r's which are to be found in 12-20,
amounting to eight* in all, while the terminationes recurs much
more frequently. <

Crmously enough, in the Polla inscription,† although extending
to a fev lines only, we have examples of all the three forms: PON-
TEIS OMNEIS, HOMINES, FORVM AEDISQVE POPLICAS,
all in the accusative, and PAASTORES in the nominative.

Priscian (p. 553) tells us, on the authority of Pliny, that some
states of Italy, especially the Umbrians and the Ernncam, had Ποῖ
