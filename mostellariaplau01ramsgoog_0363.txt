220 PLAVTI Mos'sELLana.

ego vero quamodrem disertius nesab, ‘why, for that matter, in sooth,
l do not hriow why you are doing that!

Sometimes the qualification introduced hy qum is so strong that it
must be translated ‘nay, on the contraryt’ Trin. IV. ii 87, C. Lubet
audere, ne'ri molestam ert. S. Quin dtiwprb dicere: here φιιίη refers to
tbe foregoing mertem* (disagreeable 1) nay, on the contrary, 1 am
most eager to tell you ;' Mete. Ι. 43, Egom’ aurem tr'br' ωφιιαιη quic·
quam sommus solemn proleque? Qum eiam pernequam sin emarus, scis,
si mmfr'm' vole, ‘do you think it possible that I would dare to tell
you a falsehoodl No, on the contrary, before 1 open my lips, you
know' &c.; Most. IV. ii. 38 (iii. 15), P. Nam nr'si Ιιίητ hodie emi·
grevil, auf lteri, cerlo παὶ) Hic hadriam. T. Qm'n sex memes dem
lic nemo habetat, ‘why, on tbe contrary, I tell you,' &c.; Mero. lI.
ii. 54, L. Ad portum propero: nam ibi malti negabam est. D. Bene
ambulate. L. Bene valeta D. Bene nl fibi: here Lysimachus quits
the stage and Demipho continues, Qun mihi quoque enirm ert ad
perirem regenam, Nunc adeo ibo illuc: Demipho replies to his own
thoughts as it were, ‘dare any one suppose that 1 am going to remnin
here? No, on the contrary,1 also have business at the harbour,
and therefore 1 will now repair thither!

The use of φηίη in the following passages may, at first sight, cause
some embarrassment, but they may be referred to one or other of
the classes examined above: Stich lv, ii. 44, G. Quid grint?
E. Dixi equidem e'n carcerem ires. G. Oanis, rasserr's, Eo quoque ido,
‘veli then,’ ‘nay, for that matter,’ or simply ‘but if you give the
order, 1 shall go even thither' (to prison) ; where quin qualifies eo
quoque idn Many editors reed ri sinceris, but siis not found in the
best MSS, and is unnecessary, in so far as the construction is con·
cemed, the perfect of the subjunctive being frequently employed to
indicate an hypothesis; thus Iuv. S. 111. 77, omm'a nonr't Graeculm
esuriens, in eaelum, riesserri, r'br'f: Trin. II. ii. 60, Non eo hoc dico qum,
quae tu ur's, ego uelem e! sacrem lubens, ‘I do not say this for the
purpose of implying that 1 arn not villing to accommodate myself
to your wishes, and to do cheerfully what you desire,' where φιιίη is
equivalent to u! nom Merc. II. iii. 93, the father and son are disputing
about Pasicompsa, Demipho says, Viginti mirri. operor, posse me ellam
uendere. C. A! ego si uelem, ιἀηι dantur septem et uegr'nti melnae. D. At
ego . . . C. Quin, ego, r'requom . .. D. ΑΙ nester quid dietum stin, fuce:
qur'n here marks an eager interruption-Demipho says, ‘But Ι (would
gisel! C. ‘N0, but 1, 1 tell you, (womd give more) ;‘ lv, iv. 25.
