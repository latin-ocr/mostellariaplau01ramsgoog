L1GE, n. 13063 PELLIGE, n 1007 ; SVFRAGIVM [U‚ 121,
SVFRAGIO [12 20]; SVBFRAGIA, n. 1492. We find in in·

line in Plautus, Poen. 1. ii. 67, Aa. Milphio, aaut Milphio, uli es?
M. Assum opud le, amm! Α. Ego elixus sis uolo: where the pun
would be destroyed ii we were to read Adrum instead ol Assum.

There is a remarkable sostening of the preposition ad into ar, os
which we have a few examples: thus ARFVISE, affimant),
ARVORSVM, all in 10, and ARVORSARIO three times in 12.

Generally speaking, therefore, in printing the text of Plautus it will
be safe to retain the prepositions in composition unchanged, except
in such cases as acn'pio, where our authorities are all opposed to the
harder form.

Doubling of Semrbowcls and Mults.

That the earliest Latin writers did not double the semivowels is
asserted by Quintilian, 1.0. 1. vii 14, “semivocales non geminare
diu fuit usitatissimi moris,'' words which however do not necessarily
imply that they never doubled them. The same statement is made
more broadly by Festus and his abbreviator Paulus, and they in
several passages extendit to consonante in general, e. g. Fest. s. v.
rolzlaurilah, p. 293, ed. Mult, “quod si a sollo et lauris earum
hostiamm ductum est ‘nomen antiquae consuetudinis, perunum L
enuntiari non est mirum, quia nulla tunc geminabatur litera in scri·
bendo; quam consuetudinem Ennius mutavisse fertur, ut pote Graecus
Graeco more usus, quod illi aeque scribentes ac legentes duplicabant
mutas semi (amalec el lepardus);” and again, s. v. porigam, p. 218,
“ Porrgam dixisse antiqui videntur pro Pom’gom propter morem non
ingeminandamm literarum;’' s. v. polet, p. 205, “Pelet pollet, quia
nondum geminabant antiqui consonantes.” So also av. torum, p. 355,
and Paul. Diae. s. vv. antu, p. 6 3 ab aloes, p. 19 ; aulas, p. ²3·

We have already had occasion to advert to the contradictions and
confusion which prevaii among the later grammarians upon this
subject, and therefore we need not now examine their discusnom.

Our most ancient inscriptions fndly bear out the statement of
erintilian, provided we admit that the words milanissim' morti denote
that the practice, although general, was not invariable. Thus in 1
we have PARISVMA3 in 2 we have AVLLA and HISPALLI, hut
the date of this is by no means certain; in 4, GESISTEL LICV·
