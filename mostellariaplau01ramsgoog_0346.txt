EXCVRSVS V.-MOD0. 203

is about to begin a long story to which he has no time to listen,
replies quickly, ‘certainly not :' and then adds testily, ‘even now (at
this critical time) he is entering upon some history or other! The
punctuation ought to be, Ima: etiam narrationis mabri ambiam.
The common punctuation is Ima cnam: and the translation given is
‘ yes, certainly :’ which is manifestly altogether inconsistent with the
impatient haste os Davus

V.-MODO.

Although Modo does not present the same complicatious as Adeo,
we nevertheless find the discussions with regard to this word overlaid
with perplexiug and useless distinctions and refinements.

The fact is that neoda employed as an adverb has two, and not
more than two, separate meanings, which are represented in English by

1. ‘Only' or ‘provided only!

Il. ‘Just now!

These have no obvious connection, although in reality the second
is only a particular case ol the first, but both flow directly and easily
from the proper signification oi modus. We shall examine them
separately.

1. Mada signifying ‘only' or ‘provided only.’ The primitive
meaning of modus is ‘a measure,’ and hence ‘a definite quantity'
ol any object* Thus moda conveys the idea ol something definite,
bounded, and therefore limited; Most l. iii. 43, Nihilo ego, queam
nunc iu, ansata sum, atque uni moda gessi marem, ‘I devoted mysell to
one person only,’ or, in other words, ‘l limited my affections to a
single lover 3' Pseud. 1. iii. 30, Patra ut semel moda, Balla, hue cum
lucra respicias, ‘once only,’ ‘limiting yourself to this single occasion ;’
ii. 88, T u autem quae pro capite argaitum mihi eam iamque saepe numeras,
Ea paa'sci moda scas, sed quae pacta es nan seis salvere, ‘you know only
how to make a bargain, but do not know how to keep it,' ‘your
knowledge is limited to making a bargain ;' As. 11. ii. 8, Aetatem uelem
sanim Libanum ui conveniam mado, ‘1 would be content to remain
a slave ior ever could Ionly meet Libanus’ ‘provided only,' ‘with
this limitation;' Phor. l. ii. 9, D. Quid isim esi? G. Scies Mada ut
iacere passas, ‘provided only,' ‘with this limitation, that you can hold
your tongue;' Cic. de Off. 111. 19, ξ 77, Huic egitur vira barm, quem
Fembria eiiam, non mado Sacrales nmerai, ‘an acquaintance with whom
