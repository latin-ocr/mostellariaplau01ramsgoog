a later hand To the same class belong erasures made we cannot
tell by whom, as in 1. i. 4²· ‚

Non omncs possunt obre unguenta exotr'ca,
which was originally written in B,

Non omnes possunt dolere unguento exonia,
but the t has been erased, leaving only a saint trace, and this erasure
mayor may not have been the work ol the first hand. Ritschl
therefore is hardly justified in giving tolete as the reading of Ba
without remark*

3. Corrections in inlr which is perlectly blach, and which must
proceed from alate hand Most ol the stops and marks ol interro·
gation have been added hy this hauri These corrections in black
inlr are made in two ways, either in the word, or over the word.
Thus in 1. i. 15 the writing in the original hrown inlr has

Rus mr‘lri tu obr‘ecta samhcredo tramit,
hut an s is added in hlack inlr at the end ol obtecto· oc has been
added to the lr in inu darker than the original,† but this rnay arise
lrorn an erasure made between sane and credo, some wrong word
having stood there. A point has been added in red inlr aster obtectas,

so that the whole now stands,

Rus mihi tu obr‘ectas. sambucredo hanah.

Again‚ 1. i. 31 was written originally in B,
Ante boc est labztus pactas nec magis contraeas,
but an r has been inserted in blaclr inlr after α in pocus, and an
n also in black written over the a in contristas, so that the line
now appears in the MS. r n
Antehac est annus pucros nec magr's contristor.
This hand is called Bb by Ritschl.

4. Corrections on the margin, written in a particularly neat, small
hand with atine-pointed pen, and preceded by a t. The inlr of
. this hand is intermediate in colour between the brown ol the original
MS. and the jer-blaclr os the last corrector. This hand is called
Bc by Ritschl. We have a good example os the correctiones this

hand in 1. i. 5, Ι
Exi r'nquanr . nr'dorc capenam quid tales* t cnlrng.

* [My opinion is that the t is by the fust hand. The inlr isos the same

colour, an the correction appears to have been made at once—En]
†[l cannot agree with the author in thinking the inl of this cor·
rection darier than that oi the original writing. lt appears to me to be,

il anything, somewhat lainter than the average-En]
