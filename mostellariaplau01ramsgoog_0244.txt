3¹· in attemperant] ie. ‘moving in a different direction, towards
a different goal! The young scholar must remember thatin is
followed by the accusative not only when it denotes actual physical
motion towards a person, place, or thing, but also when it denotes
an action tending towards some definite result, or a movement oi the
mind in the directiones or towards any particular object So below,
v. 64, in vsperum, ‘against evening,’ i. e. ‘with aview to my evening
repast3' and so 1. ii. 38 (41), in firmatam, ‘with a view to secure

strength ς’ and in the next line, in usum, ‘with a view to their being ,

practically serviceable3' in ιιιιιιιι, ‘with aview to iair appearance,' &a

33. Quoi oti, ιιαιιιιιι, nte, αιιι qaod ego agam mano] i. e. ‘what
business bave you, confound you, to look aster me or my proceed-
ingsi' The construction quid curatio est tibi me, in which tbe
accusative is put aster the verbal substantive in io, is by no means
uncommon in Plautus. Quid ιιίι hanc curant est rem, verbm, αιιι
manlio? Amph, I. iii. 213 Sed qm'd tibi, nos nando: hmo, tach'o ιιιι

oh· hanc nono est, amaeam meam Truc. II. vii. 61. ln all the
above examples, with the exception of that from Amph. 1. iii. ar,
where rem is in reality equivalent to me, we have the accusative of
a person; when a place is introduced, sometimes a preposition
is supplied before the accusative, as Quid ιιίι od hasce occessm
aedes est prope ιιι pallatio? Truc. 11. ii. 3 (cl. Quid illi ex utero
exilio est? Truc. II. vi. 3o); and sometimes the accusative is
expressed by an adverb, Quid illi rcdrhh huc ιιιαιιι suri? Most ΙΙ.
i. 303 Quid tibi interpellani» aut in conciliem huc accersio ιιιι

examples, ι. the clause i's interrogative with qm'd, the verb sunt, and
the dative oi a pronoun‘ (libi, ιιιιιι, vohi, illi) ; a. the verbal sub·
stantive ends in io; 3. there is uniformly an expression ol impatience,
indignation, remonstrance, or anger. Hence such constnrctions as
