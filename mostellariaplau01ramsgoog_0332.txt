EXCVRSVS Ill-ETIAM. 189

ridicule, and thus the idea of addition is connected with ‘even now,' as
it is with ‘still’ and ‘yet,’ in such phrases as ‘give me still (or yet)
another volume,' that is, a volume ‘in addition to' those previously
given. All these words may denote the repetition of an action, and
hence etiem alque etiam means ‘again and again!

4. But the expression ‘is the man even now awakel' may imply
‘is the man, having been for some time asleep, yet awakel’ and
hence ‘even now' may indicate that things having continued in one
particular state for some time, this state hasbeen or is likely to be
interrupted. Questions such as the above are frequently put with
some degree of surprise or impatience‚ and this is often rendered
emphatic in English by the introduction of a negative. Thus, ‘is the
man not even ηοω awake?' ‘is the man not going even ηοω to hold
his tongue l' and hence ‘even uo‘w' is often equivalent to ‘at last’

We may proceed to give examples of mam under each of the
above heads.

1. ‘Even now,' ‘at this present time,' &c ; Amph. l. i. 47, Sed quo
modo el verbis qur'bus me decetsabularier, Prr'us ipo mecum ettam uolo hic
nudaturi, i. e. ‘even ηοω, at this present time ;’ Aul. IV. iv. 6, Verbera·
helricum, ctzhm rogatos? non sur, sed trasur, ‘do you even ηοω heap
questions on me when l have detected you in the very act of trying
to rob mei’ Most. 111. i. 19, Etiam saleim de horpale? ‘does he even
now (after being accused by you) confess about his guest l' Pers. lV.
iii. 72, Eiram tu illam destinas? D. Videam modo Mercimonr'um, ‘are
you going to buy her even ηοω-οη the spotl' In both of the last
quoted examples we should in English have inserted a negative:
‘does he not even now confessl’ and ‘adut you going to buy her
on the spotl' V. ii. 66, D. Malum vobis dabo. T. A! libi nos dedi-
mus dabthrusque etiam D. Her'nates pervellit! It is evident from the
exclamation of Dordalus that the threat of Toxilus was instantly exe·
cuted. l would therefore translate, ‘we have brought misfortune upon
you, and we will do the same even novv' or ‘directly‚' rather than
render etrbm by ‘again' or ‘in addition! Cas. ll. viii. 86, Stalino says
to Olympi0, ‘be off with you (aba), ldo not wish money to be spared,
purchase liberally,’ and then adds, with reference to abi, Nam nrr'hi
odino hoc citiam corruente est opus, ‘for I must have a meeting with this
neighbour of mine even ηοω (directly).’ Pseud. l. v. 153, Pseudolus,

addressing his audience, says, ‘l dare say you suppose that l have
promised to perform all these achievements merely to keep you
amused, and that l have not really any intention of carrying them
out,’ Non demulabo .· atque etaiam [quod] certum sciam, Quo srmsacturus
