NOTES. 1. l. 63, 64. 111

cali’* Upon the whole, although 1 leel no confidence, Ι arn inclined
to consider that caedite is here equivalent to canu'dite, and is used
with reference to effercite,sarcie signiiying properly to stuff a sausage,
‘eat‚ stuff yourselves out like sausages, chop up the good things!

⁶3· ire. . . parare] ie. ‘to go to the Piraeus ior the purpose of
procuring.' This use of the infinitive to denote a purpose or design,
especially aster averb of motion, is extremely rare in the writers oi
the Augustan age, but is by no means uncommon in Plautus, as will
appear from the lollowing examples: thus, Amph. Ι. i. 106, Nunc
pergam heri imperium exsequi, et me dmum capessere ,· Bac.11. iii. rao,
Senex iu Ephesum ibit aurum arcessere ,· IV. iii. 18, Parasitus
meda venerat aurum petere ,· IV. viii. 59, Illa auten iu arcem
abibit aedem visere Mineruae; Curc. 1. iii. 50, Minunu .· nam para·
suammet audies quartus Cariam Petere argentum ,· Rud. I. ii. 6,
Nune huc ad Veneris sanum venie ve'sere,· iv. 4, Οηιηία ciem circum·
cursavi atque omnr'bus in latebris ⁴ perreptavi Quaerere conservam uoce,
oculis, auri'bus, ut pervestigarem Truc. V. 1, Eo mr'tli meare (a very
strange phrase); Trin. IV. iii. 6, Ecce homimem te, Stasime, nc'lrili!
sutria in thermipolio Condalium es oblitus, postquam thermopotasti gut·
turem! Recipe te, et recurre petere, re recenti,· Pseud. 11. ii. 47,
Reddere hoc nen perdere herus me maid. IV. v. 4, quoted by W,
is not an example according to the common reading. Nor dol
think that Amph. 1. i.106, quoted above, falls under this head.
See example oi constructions ol perga.

64. piscatum] Piscatus must here signify ‘a dish ol fish! So¹
below, 111. ii. 41, piscatu proba ‘excellent lish3' and in Cic. de Fin.
11. 8, piscatu, aucupia, venedam, signiiy ‘the produce oi fishing,
sowling, and the chase.' The meaning varies in different passagesz
in Bac. L i. 69, mnus pricatres is ‘a good take or haul ol lish3' and
so Rud. IV. ii. 6, piscatu novo me uberi competebat (sc. Neptunus),
while in the next line pileatus seems to be the ‘act ol lishing,'
Miroque mode atque incredibili hic piscatus milri Lepide euenit, i. e. ‘this
fishing ol mine,' but it may mean here also, ‘this haul os fish3' in
Rud. 1v. i. 7, abiit pacatum ad mare must mean, ‘he went away
a·fishing to the sea3' and so itis used by Plin. H. N. Vill. 16,§ 17,
omnium ques uenatus aucupia piscatusque alebant. Piscatus, like
genitus, senatus, sumptus, tumultus, and many others, belonged also
to the second declension in the earlier form of the language, and
Non s. v. piscati, p. 488, quotes lrom Pomponius amne piscati genus,

⁸ The translation given in the English ed, ‘chew your mast,’ ‘exercise
your grinders,’ is vague and quite wide of Foris meaning.
