METRE AND PROSODY. lxxxiii

trisyllable (=malyerts) in Most. l. iii. ¹3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), where
all the MSS. have,

Non ueram amatores amant aalma scd vestrl fartum.

Pylad, Bothe, and R. have re-written the line invarious ways: I
would scan it,

Non vestient amaltorcs Ι amant ΙΙ muhdrl' Ι sed ucslti' finitum

In verbs, Ritschl allows that sczb in all its parts, and also nescu, &c.‚
admit syniaesis freely3 at‘s and ait may be monosyllables, and aibant
in all its persons a dissyllable. Such forms as audibam, aa, he
regards as grammatical rather than metricat and with these excep·
tions he lays down a canon that, in the case of verbs (as in the case
oi nouus, with the exception os dr'u, deis, and trram), the letter ι’
never forms a synizesis with any vowel following it in the more
regulm menes, but only in Octonarians and Anapaests. But we
have an undoubted instance of sarm in Capt. Ill. v. 5 (Seme),

Nam semper occant parasquam sarra—unt monet}

which R. would attempt violently to get rid of by substituting careant,
a form unheard ol elsewhere. So ambrie'nt, Mil I. 69 (Senam), where
all the MSS. have,

Moleshhe mart, orant, aalma, opsecrant.

In the same manner R. vainly endeavours to get rid ol everunt, Trin.
Ι. i'u 33 commin, Most 11. i. 485 provenffirt, a. 67; substituting the
forms evenat, evenant, provenunt, lor what is in each case the reading

a. tte letter V. In lile manner the charactera being employed
to denote avowel and also a consonant, which, it is probable, had
the sound ol the English w, we lind tenua, mutas, converted into
mnam, tentaras, and, without the plea of necessity, genua, curruum,
tenues, aa, become genwa, curruum, rennes, &a

Again‚ without any reference to the exigencies of verse-making,
there was a tendency in the language to drop altogether the v when
it occurred between two vowels, and to contract the vowels into one
syllable3 thus instead os movr'bz'lr's, manentum, terrenior, neuster,
propedem, we have mobr'lrt, momentum ι’κηίον, nuper, prudens, διας
while in verbs the double forms amaverunt, ιινιιανιιηί,ο amaveram,
amaram audtht‘, auriti} and the like, are employed indifferently.

Thus in the dramatum, whatever v is found between two vowels
