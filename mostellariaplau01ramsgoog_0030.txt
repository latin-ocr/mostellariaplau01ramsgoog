MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. xi

So also 1. i. ra was originally written
Seite medo venete salvos quem absentem comes,

but has been changed by correction into du
temne ' ,

Sine mode uene‘re salvis quem absentem coner

where the correction of saluos into salvum is from Bb and the
marginal comedis from Bc. The corrections of b are frequently
rough and coarse.

5. Occasionally stopa are inserted in red inlr.

6. Occasionally a black line is drawn under aword, as if to call
attention to something doubtful or erroneous, as in 1. i. 52, which
appears in B

Ocermfieeem crebrum . qaod crede fiere,

where the line under carmficum is in inlr blacker than that of the

first band. Moreover there is a mark over the first e‘, carne? cum, as
if the first hand had wished to substitute a a for the i, but it is by
no means distinct .

So again, 11. i. 70 is written, .

Neque quaequam nobes parebat excessit commode,

ue nne being in brace rna. ““““

So 11. ii. 68 was written,

Qua prenature ve'ta care operfidene,

the e at the end of premanere, the whole of the word vr‘le, and the
c following, being written over an erasure, and being much blacker
than the rest Tben some reader was startled by the combination
operfidem, and drew a line under it, and then lines were drawn to
separate the o from perfidum, so that the whole now appears as

Quia premature vela cere Q

These lines occur very frequently in several plays (e. g. the Rudent),
and more or less in all, or nearly all.

7. But there is another class of corrections in B to which
special attention must be directed. These are inserted in small
spaces lest blank in the MS, in a small, scratchy hand in red
inlr, and are intended to complete imperfect lines. These are con·
jectum! emendations by Camerarius, and wnitten in his own hand,
and therefore of no vafue except as specimens of ingenuity.
Several examples will be found in 111. i, e· g· ²²· ⁶, argenium
smori‚· v. 7, opas ἐκ euterpius suth· u. ar, aeques 1)·23, ΤΗ· Ne·
gat nequam. Ta. Perii appella· a. 24, Non cOnfimuf, and many

others.
