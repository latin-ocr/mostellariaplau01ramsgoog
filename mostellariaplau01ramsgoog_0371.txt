content to remain selme former, provided only that lcotdd meet

4. Vt, ‘that' is used very elliptically in the following passage,
where s threat is conveyed: Pers V. ii. 9, Quem polege at non in
maaian atque in compedes cogam ri atham, ‘nor shall anything pre·
vent me from consigniug this iellow to chains and torture,' where rat
aaa cogam is equivalent to nec possum prohiberi qma cogam.

There is yet another elliptical use oi ut, which may however be
ranked under (2): Poen. IV. ii. 90, Valeas, beneque ut tibi sit, where
we might supply precor, but the ellipse seems to be cura, which
appears in the next line, in the reply oi Sincerastus, Vale, ei haec cura
clanculum ul εἰπέ ὠτία] so again, Stich. Ι. ii. 48, Discipulos mma ad
magistras : quibas matronas mmr'bar, Quae optumae siml, esre oportet)
red utraque rat ditat mriti', where it is more natural to supply cura
thau precor, ‘see that each ol you two answer me!

lu a iew cases it is open to us to translate ut either by ‘how' or
by ‘in order that :' thus Cist 1. i. 95, G. Mihi uam hommem vellem
dari, Vt ega iilum narrarem! which we may render, according to the
punctuation we select, either ‘in order that I might turn him over
and over‚' or, pultiug scomma alter dari and a note of admiration
after amtorem, ‘how 1 would turn him over and over l’ the idea being
perhaps taken from a cook grilling meat, or tossing an omelette iu
airying pam The English phrase oi ‘turnhrg a person round one's
finger’ implies the same amount oi absolute control on one side, and
helplessness on the other.

ln Epid 11. ii. 40 we may translate ut either by ‘as' or ‘howt'
P. Quid erat riaduta? aa regillam tmdueulam aa meadi'culam Implu-
atatam? at istae sacrior! vestimentis namtaa, where at may be either
‘ss they call their dresses,' or, making it an exclamation, ‘how they
call,' i. e. ‘what strange names, to be sure, they give their dresses l’

In the following passages, which are all difficult, ui, is the true
reading, must be equivalent to utut: Poen. IV. ii. 9, Quodam gmur
ibi hommum videas, quati Acherontem ummah, Eqm'tem, adsim, laer·
amam, sarem ac fagiiirmm velih, Verberatam, usitatum, additium, qui
habet quad alet, ut haara esi, i.e. ‘he who has money to spond, whatever
kind of man he ie,’ where Bothe and others adopt utut, the conj. ol'
Gulielm.; Merc. Prol. 81, Amem, amarasque, u! animum obfirma mma,
Dico esse ituram me mercatum, si aelii, where at must siguify ‘as best
Imay‚' or ‘when l steel my resolution, I then say to my iather,' &ot
Pylades here reads uiui, Ritschl conj. actatum· Phor. V. iv. 1, aare
rum, ut meae res rese habent, fratri optrgt'sse qaod vali: the best MSS.
