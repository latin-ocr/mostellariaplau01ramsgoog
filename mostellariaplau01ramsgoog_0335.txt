to wake up even now, (yet) l' ln As. 1. i. 95, Demaenetus having an-
nounced to Libanus, Ego eo adsorum, nisi pro'd ιιι, instead oi walking
away still lingers, upon which Libanus urges him, I Ι ιιιιιιιιιιι om·

lv. ii. 28, ²9 (iii. 5, 6), etr'am operis . . . . etrhmne operes? ‘are you
(not) going to open the door even now, yet, at last? are you (not)

Occasionally we find one etrum closely followed by another, each
exhibiting a different modification ol meaning: thus in Amph. 1. i.
azo, Sosia bawls sor help, Proh fidem! lhebanr' eroes! M. Enim
clamos, cornustx) i. e. ‘do you dare, in addition to the rest oi your
villainy, to shout lor help against mel' but a lew lines lower down,
v. 225, M. Ειίαιιι mutter? S. Iam tacebo: signifies ‘ are you even now,
still, venturing to murmur3' so in As. 1. i. 95, a portion ol which we
gave above, D. Ego ιο adfhrum nisi quid or's. L. I, emme om·
bulas). D. Atque ιιιᾰιιι etaiam) L. Ecce. L. ‘Be off, are you not
away yetl' ‘And do you hear this besidesl’ L. ‘Well' &a See also
Pers. V. ii. 46.

Sometimes ιιιιιιι is added to ιιίαιι to give additional emphasis:
thus Amph. 1. i. 173, Lassus rum hercle ι novi, ut vectus Ιιιιι rum,
ιιίαιιι nunc nauseo, ‘even now at this present time, 1 am sicli ;' Cas.
ΙΙΙ. v. 50, Sed etrhmne habel Cartha, ιιίαιιι nunc, gladium? ‘but has
Casina still got, even at this present time, a sword ι’ Mil. IV. viii. 29,
Ειίαιιι nunc saluto te, Lar famaliaris, priusquam eo, ‘and now once
more I greet thee,’ having previously rendered this homage ; Men. 1.
ii. 48, M. Concede Ιιιιι α fhrzllus. P. Fet. M. anm concede huc.
P. Licet. M. Eisone ιιιιιιι concede audacter ab leontino cavo,· and so
esactly Aul. I. i. 16, Apscede-ettam nunc—etrum nuere-ettam—
Ohe! Illic astato. In both passages etr'czm signifies ‘further,' ‘an
additional space,' and ιίιὶιιιι manc is ‘further still! Amph. V. i. 30,
Scin me ίιιιιιιι esse herum Amphitruonem? B. Scio. A. Viden enom

nunc) B. Scio, ‘even now when you look again steadily! ln Truc. ,
