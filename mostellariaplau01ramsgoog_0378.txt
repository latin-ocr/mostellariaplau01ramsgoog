EXCVRSVS xit-NIMIS, NIMI VS, dec. 235

⁴· Νὺιιιὶ) as an adverb. lllr'rnio is used, adverbially in clauses in
which comparison is expressed or implied

(a) In the great majority of instances it is combined with the
comparative degree os an adjective or adverb: thus Moschion,
nimio celerius, ‘more quickly by far;’ ii. 66 (60), mono nequior,
‘worse by far;' 11. ii. 12, naono expectatio, ‘looked sor with sar
greater pleasure ;’ V. 'a 54 (ii. 39), naioth plus seprio, ‘I am wiser by
a great deal ς’ so nemra aequriu, Merc. 111. ii. 63 minio calvas, Trin.
11. ii. 1063 m'mlo docilior, Bac. 1. ii. 56; nimio facilius, Pseud. l.
iii. 473 nrinrb lubentius, Men. V. vi. 153 nimio melius, Pers. 1. iii.
31, Trnc. 11. v. 173 nimio maleus, Rud. Ι. iii. 1, 11. v. 3, Truc. 11.
v. 33 mhar'o octies, Stich. V. v. 53 nimio plus, Bac. 1. ii. 14; nainlo
pluras, Trin. Ι. i. ης nimio reculas, Bac. 11. iii. 80; nobrio soltus,
1. ii. 42, Trin. 11. ii. 30.

(b) Sometimes nrhvr'o is connected with averb which implies
comparison: thus Bac. ΙΙΙ. ἰὶ. 12,Ii71'ntlo praesul inpendiosum te quom
ingratum dr'cr'er,· Poen. 1. ii. 90, Bonam ego want leolum me esse mou'o
dici mavolo. Into the following also the idea os comparison enters:
Trnc. IV. i. ό, Quom lroc rum volupe esl, tum hoc namo magnae mellim‘tu
mihi· that is, ‘while on the one hand, this circumstance (viz, that my
gifts have been graciously received by Phronesium) is a source oi
pleasure, on the other hand, this other circumstance (viz. that the
gista ol my rival have been scorned) is more sweet by fari melliora
is an dr. try„ and is generally understood to mean some sweet drink.
In Men. V. ii. 69, S. Tu negor. Mu. Nego hercle vero. My. Minio
haec aitpudmter ngas: the meaning is clearly ‘these denials are more
shameless by sar than your previous falsehoods.' More difficnlt is the
line at the commencement of the 6th Scene ol the 4th Act oi the
Bacchides: Nicobulus enters saying, Νιήιίο illaec res est magnae
dr‘or'o'tbe milvi, Suplersugesse sic malti hadal Chrusalum: but we may
regard this as intended to be the continuation ol a soliloquy com·
menced by Nicobulus before he appeared on the stage, in which,
after having mentioned some annoynnm, he goes on, ‘far more am
1 incensed by the circumstance that Chrysalus: tec.

(c) Sometimes the emphasis is increased by the addition ol mullo:
Bac. 1. ii. 42, Vr’deo minu rom mullo plus quamodrem, Vixisse nimio
souin est abm mom urbm· and again in the same play, IV. iv. ao,
M. Clrusole, occr'di. C. Fortassis lu ouri dempsa'slr' parum. M. Qui,
molum, pamm? aino uero nimio mrbus mullo porum while we find in
Stich. 11. ii.15‚ mono inperitior mullo mulo plus quom speras. ln

Most. 111. iii. 2 (IV, ii. a), Num nepteo amplae libi uebatur? (sc. aedos}
