emphasis, but was equivalent in many cases to the indefinite article 'a
or on, which is in reality one or one, and was anciently employed
¹ just aa un, uno, etit, etc. are in modern languages. Plautus will afford

several examples: in this play, IV. ii. 67 (iii. 44), we have Vnus oa'c ,

seruos est socerruntus,· and IV. iii. 9 (iv. 9), Vnum vt'oli mortuom
efferrt'soras,· so Capt llI. i. aa, unum reditatum debeam Epid. ΙΙΙ. iv.
17‚Polego magis anum quaero, ie. ‘I seek (some) one! ln Trin. IV.

iv. 11,Curre in Piraeum, atque unum carrt'caclum sace, which Weiss j

explains by saying “ unum pleonastiee ut saepius,” unum Is highly
emphatic, ‘run to the Piraeus and make one course of it,' ie. ‘do
not halt sor a moment! In Pseud. I. i 52 (q. u), nunc anae quatitque
remorantur minoe may signify ‘a matter ot five minae,’ but unae is
here rather equivalent to solae or solum, ‘now the balance os five minae
. alone detains me here ;' and so tres unos passam Bac. IV. vii, 34.

Ι 147. Ducere, Ductore, Ca'rcumducere, perductura, perducor, all
occur in the same sense in the course os this play. In Pers. IV.
lv. 85, Omne ego pro nihilo csse duco quodsuit quando fuir, the MS.
reading ducto in this sense is an tr. λεγ. W reads duco.

111. ii. 10. Toto turget mv'lti uxor] i. e. ‘is all in a ferment'
There is aline in Cas. lI. v. 17 which may serve as acommeutary,
Nunc t'n fermento tola est, ito herge! nu'hi.

12. cubandum est mala] The same expression in As. IV. ii. 87,
Male cubandum est: abdicatum me uxor adducti damam

79. Quasi fiagtiator] i. e. ‘like a dun! See note on v. 55.

110. Sr'bt'quisque ruri metat] Aproverbial expression equivalent
to ‘every one lor himself in this world' or ‘charity begine at home!
Compare Epid. lI. ii. 80, Milo t'stt'c nec sertim nec neither, ie. ‘I
have no interest in that matter, it does not concern me!

111. Redht'lere is a technical legal term employed when a
purchaser returns the article purchased upon the hands os the seller
on account of some defect. The explanation of Ulpian is perfectly
distinct (Digest. XXI. 1, i αι), “Redhr'bere est facere ut rursus habeat
,venditor quod habuerit;” and so Festus p. 270, ed. Muti, where
however the text is somewhat corrupt The act of returning ao
object under these circumstances was called Redhe'bioh, and a suit
brought to compel the seller to receive the object and to return
the price was Actio Redhibitort'o, and so Iudaicam Redht'torticm. Sec
Digest XXI. 1, h 18, 48, 54, 60; see also Quintih Ι.Ο. VIII. 3,
