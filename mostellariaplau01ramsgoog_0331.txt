Ill—ETIAM.

Although Etiam, in Plautus, appears at first sight to bear several
meanings differing widely from each other, it will be found that it is,
in very many instanceS, equivalent to the English ‘even now,’ and
perhaps we ought in all such cases to resolve etaiam into its component
parts and write them separately, as et ram. It must be borne in mind
that the iorce ol ‘even now' is variously modified according to the
general sense ol the passages into which these words enter. Thus,

1. ‘Even now' signifies ‘at this present time,' ‘directly,' ‘without
delay,' in such phrases as ‘the battle is even now going on,’ ‘I must
leave you even now‚’ and the like.

a. With a negative ‘even now' may signisy ‘ yet,’ ‘as yet,' ‘up to
this time,' in such phrases as ‘even now the boy cannot write,' ‘even
now I have never employed him in such work!

3. The expression ‘is the man even now awakei' may imply ‘is
the man, having been ior some time awake, still awake l' and hence it
appears that ‘even now' may indicate that things are continuing with-
out intenuption in the same state in which they have been ior some
time previously. So, when we say ‘he is even now beating his
slave,’ or ‘he is even now mocking me,' these words may indicate
that the person spoken os is continuing an action previously conr·
menced-that he is inflicting fresh punishment or heaping up fresh
