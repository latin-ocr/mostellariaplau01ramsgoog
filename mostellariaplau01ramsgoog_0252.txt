62. sugebam caedite] This expression is very embarrassing. Let
us first examine the meaning of the word ecgrice. In the writers upon
rural affairs it signifies the act or process oi fattening domestic animala*
Thus Varro R. R. 111. ιο says that five points must be attended to
in the management os geese-de genere, de setara, de auci, de palles, de
sagena, i. e. ‘the breed,’ ‘the propagation,' ‘the eggs,' ‘the goslings,' and
‘the process of fattening ;' and Columella VIII. 14 tells us that when
the goslings are four months old the largest are to be selected and set
asida for fattening, sarturae maxchcrcs quasque destinatum· and then
goes on, et est facilis harum aocicm sagam, i. e. ‘the process olfattening
these birds is easy ;' so also Plin. H. N. IX. 56, t 82 informs us, on
the authority oi Varro, ssiat Fulvius Lupinus, a short nme before the
civil war, was the,mst who kept snails in a preserve (coclearum vetraria Ι
cnstc'tuit), and proceeds, queis et saginam carun commentus cst sapa et

sarre altisque gencrchae dic. In the above passages the word sagena
denotes the ‘art' or ‘process of fattening,' and hence it easily
passed into the signification found in Tacitus, Juvenal, hc, of the
‘materials used 'lor fattening' ‘nourishing rich food,' and hence ‘food'
in general. This use is not, however, confined to the writers who

* Gesner, in his Index to the R. R. Scriptores, worrld connect the word
with the Greek verb σάττο.
