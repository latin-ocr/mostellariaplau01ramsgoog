PROLEGOMENA.

11. Mantucrrpts.

The authority cf MSS. must be considered inferior to that of
the grammarians. Many of them were written at alate period (the
oldest MSS. of Plautus belong tc the tenth century); they passed
through the hands cf a series cf transcribere, many of whom were
' ignorant, and many careless; and so little attention was paid to such
matters, that we repeatedly find the orthography cf the same word
varying in the same MS.; and hence not only particular words but

, the forms of particular inflexions present the same variations (eg. in

the cese cf plural terminaticns in is cr cs). lt may indeed be urged
that where we meet with an archaic word in the MSS. of Plautus,
even although that form is not unifcnnly observed, we may conclude
that it is an archaism which has been transmitted from a remote
period and preserved by the hand cf the faithful copyist, and ought
therefore at once to be admitted and adopted universally. But this
is by no· means a safe principle. Thus, although in the earliest
Palimpsests we find uniformly adulescens and eprhhda we have no
right tc infer that this is actually the archaic form, which would
naturally accord more closely with the Greek, but, on the contrary,
may only be the mode of spelling which became fashionable in the
fourth or fifth centuries. Again, although we find in the best MSS.
of Plautus the word hem in the great majority of cases written erres
without the aspirate, yet when we remember the variatione which
took place in the use cf the aspirate at different epocha it is just
as likely that erus may be a modern as an ancient form Where
the archaism is undoubted, we know it tc be such only from
inscriptions, and in certain cases from the testimony of the gram·
marians. We ought therefore in all cases to betake ourselves at
once to the best evidence, where we have it at cur command. Ι
conceive that it would be just as reasonable to attempt tc establish
the orthography of the English langue-ge in the age of Queen
Elizabeth by the aid cf the text of Shakespeare, as exhibited in the
edition os Johnson and Malcne, as tc ascertain the orthography
of the Latin language in the sixth century of the city by the aid of
the existing MSS. of Plautus.. ln either case theold form world

be preserved here and there, while the great mass would be ccm-
pletely modernised.
