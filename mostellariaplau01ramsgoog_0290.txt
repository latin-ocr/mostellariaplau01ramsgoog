to undergo Capiti Deminutio. This being premised, the adjective
Capitolii when employed with reference to (a) and (3) may be applied
to what aflects the phynial lfi, or to what affeets the polzh'cal lfi.
r. As aflecting the physical life it signifies literally ‘deadly or
‘dangerous to lite: and in this sense it occurs in Mil II. iii. 23,
Tuis nunc crura'bus capitique fraudem capitalem dim creas, i. e. ‘you
are raising up a deadly injury to limb and life ;' sd capitali ex
anhelo, Rud. 11. iii. 19; vectus capitali periculo, Trin. IV. iii. 813
and figuratively, Poen. IV. ii. 57, Scin fu herum tuum mco hero
esse chimaeram capitalem, i. e. ‘a deadly enemy 3' so ira capitolii in
Hor. S. 1. vii. 133 and odram capitale in Cicero de Amr. Hence
Capitalis signifies ‘terrible,' ‘atrocious,' as in the passage now
before us, and in Adel. IV. vii. g, D. Fero aliia flagitia adia in-
gentia Boni v‘lltics adulescente. M. Ecce aulem. D. Noua, Capitolia,
ie. ‘atrocious3’ and so in Cicero we have capitalis matri, capi·
falti rhrashh'a, coptialm ct pestfferum Antonii reditum, and even
capitalis homo. a. As affecting the political life capitolii is ex-
tensively employed with regard to criminal proceedings. Since the
punishment for some criminal offences was death, but for a much
larger class was some penalty which entailed capitii machuti, the
phrases res capitolii, causa soczims craincn capitale, radiatam capi-
’ tale, poem capitolii, taken by themselves, are ambiguous, and their
force must in each case be determined by the context. They
moy signifya ‘capital' charge trial or punishment, according to the
English force of the term in such cases, but much more frequently
they indicate merely a charge trial or punishment affecting the poli-
tical privileges but not the life of the person implicated. 3. Since
anytbing which affects either the physical or political life of an
individual is of serious importane'e to him, capitalis occasionally
signifies ‘of paramount importance;' and so we may take Stich. Ill.
ii. 46, Eam auspiiavv‘ ego in re capitali mea, ‘upon her I depended for
an omen when all my best interests were at stake' 4. Occasionally,
Caprialis is found in the sense of ‘excellent' as when we talk of
‘a capital speech,’ ‘a capital dinner‚’ or the lilre; thus Ovid. Fast.
111.a39; Cic. ad Q. F. 11. 13; Trebell. Poll. XXX. Tyrann. 10 ; all
oi which are quoted in Forcellini.

Before quitting Capitolii we must notice Capitol, which is used as
a substantive, but appears to be merely the abbreviated form of the

neuter capitale. It is used r. with linteum, vetamentum, uelum or some ,

such word understood, to signify a naplrin worn upon the head by

priestesses. “Item texta fasciola qua capillum in capite alligarent
