ORTHOGRAPHY. xlix

Some forms os orthography seem to have been adopted by the very
earliest Roman writers, which, like the duplication os the vowel, passed =
away at once: thus Priscian, p. 556, tells us on the authority oi
Varro, “de origine Linguae Lotinoe‚” that the “vetustissimi auctores
Romanorum '' wrote Agchises, agcepo, aggultcs, aggeus, aggur'lla, igge-
runt, ior Anchises, anceps, angulus, angens, angm‘llo, ingeram, as the
Greeks wrote ἅγγελος, Ἀγχίσηςε see also p. 569, and Mar. Victorin.
pp. 2462, 2465.
