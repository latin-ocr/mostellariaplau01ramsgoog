94 PLAVTl MOSTELLARlA. ι

in Pers. ll. ii. rr, Scri> fidei hercle herilia! soleat intpudr'crbit oppro-
drarr'cr, where fidei herili means ‘honesty oi a slave (i. e. when a slave
is honest) in the service of his master3' and the import of the passage
is, ‘l know that it is usual lor a slave who is honest in the service of
his master to be twitted with impure motives! ln sofar as the
sentiment ol the passage is concerned, it is repeated below, IV.i
3, 5. Weise, who explains “Sensus debet esse: scio heros non
stare solere promissis,” has entirely mistaken the meaning, which
was correctly apprehended hy Acidalius.
4. te. . . ulnicarprobe] We have the same words in PoenV. iv. 58,
Nunc pol ego te ulcncarprobe. Vlcr'scor, in Plautus and Terence, is

generally construed‚ as here, with the accusative of the person on'

whom vcngeance is to be taken* Sometimes we have in the
ablative the kind oi punishment, as Casili. 8, Flagitium allud
homritt's! ego r'llum same, ego t'llum Siti, maledictu, malfitani, amatorem

Wct'scm: but it is also construed with the accusative oi the thing on‘

account ol which vengeance is talren, as in this play, the third linc
from the end, Ibi utrumque, et ltoc el illud, poteris unzter· proba· so also

Poen. V. v. 1, Si ego mairam non ullus suero prode, quam lenoni dedi ·

Tum prrffecto mc sibi habento scurrae ludrficotm‘, and Trin. V. ii. 49,
Miserum est mole promert'to, ut merila, n' milri ulcisci non lt'cet, i. e. ‘It
is very provolring if 1 am not allowed to inflict upon evil deeds the
punishment they have deserved.’ This is the speech of Charmides
after he had unwillingly agreed to forgive his son. Weise appears
to have mistaken the meaning when he says, ‘⁴ Sensus: miserum est
si mihi non licet et filiurn punire, et amicum remunerare aut gratius
referre ei ;’' and he seems to have had some misgiving‚ for he adds,
‘¹ Sed haec sententia aliquanto plus iusto perplexa est.”

5. Exi, taquam, nudor, e culcita] i. e. ‘come lorth, you stinldng
scullion! The reading is very doubtful,'and was probably suggested
to Pylades or some othcr early corrector by the line in Juvenal S.
V. 162, Captum te mitiore suae putat ille culcitas, and that in Martial
1. xciii. (xcii.) 9, Pasceris e! nigrae solo nidore culinae. th'dor properly
signifies the smell, smoke, or vapour proceeding from some object

, when burned, and generally indicates a rank, loetid, or suffocating
