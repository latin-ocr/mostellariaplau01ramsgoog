Before quitting this subject, we may notice that the preposition ab,
occasionally, although rarely, appears under the form of cy: thus in
15, AF VOBIS; in the Polla inscription, AF CAPVA, but in the
same, AB REGIO3 n. 2243, AF MVRO; n. 1161,AF SOLO·;
see also nn. 552, 587, which are less satisfactory.

Ten Latin words end with the letter d-Ad, Aliud, Apud, Haud,
Id, Illud Istud, Quid, Quod, Sed. It seems certain 21222, in later
times at least, the sound of din these words could not be distin-
guished from that of 222221 that, in writing them, t was frequently
substituted for d. Thus Quintil. 1. Ο. 1. vii 5, “llla quoque servata
est 2 multis differentia, ut ad, quum esset praepositio, D literam,
quum autem coniunctio, T acciperet” These words clearly indicate
21222, whichever letter was employed, the sound must have been the
same, and seems to imply that many persons, and probably Quin-
tilian himself, employed d aud t indifferently in writing the words
in question.

12 2122 testimony of the later grammar-lans, 1222 aod opinion, theory

Scaurm (p. 2252) considers 12 2 mistahe to write the preposition
with a t, or the conjunction with 2 d, proving that the hrterchange
was not uncommom Velius Longus (pp. 2232, 2287) tells us that
to avoid confusion we ought to write the preposition ad and the
pronouns 2222221, quod all with ad, in order to distinguish them
from the conjunctiora ot, the verbs it and quat, and the adverb qvot‚·
he maintains that apud ought to be written with adiuuare no pre-
position ends with t, and because it sounds better “propter nimiam
Tliterae exilitatem.” On the other hand, he holds that sed ought
to be written with 2 t, became no conjunction ends with d, but admits
that in pronunciation the sound of the final letter was 2122221 drather
than of t, and that therefore the question was whether we should
write it as it was pronounced‚ or pronounce it es it was written.
