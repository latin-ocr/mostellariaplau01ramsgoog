evident that it was much more likely to be changed by transcribers
into the common lorm luae than the reverse. Thus in Aul. 111.v. 58,
Haec sunl alque altae mullae in magnis datibus Incommodilales sunap-
lusque rulolerabiles, is the reading ol the best MSS. and is retained
in the Vulg.; so Eun. III. v. 34, Abducit secum ancillas: paucae, quac
circum allam essent, manen! Novitiae puellae: cautritur daec adarnaul ul
lavel, where the reading is, apparently, not disputed3 so also Phor. ⁸
V. viii. 23, where however the reading is doubtlu1; so rilaec, nom.
pl. lem. (milae ltaecl; Hec. IV. ii. 17, S. Nihil pol tam istaec res
malci aaluplalisserunl.

11. mea ocello] ‘the apple oi my eye! Catullus employs the same
term when addressing his beloved Sirmio, Pcucicsularum, Sirmtb,
insularumque Occlle. For a collection of tenns ol endearrnent see
Excursus.

14. sapit scelesta mullum] ‘the cunning jade is very hnowing.'
Sceleslus in the dramatists bears two significatione, which mast be
kept distinct 1.1t is used in the strict literal sense ol adlaturus,-
thus below, ΙΙ. ἰὶ. 7² (71), Scelestus, aurt' causa, ‘the villain (did it)
sor the sake os gold ς’ and vituperatively, below, o. 26, Quid als,
scelesta,.‘what’s that you say, you wretchl’ and Rud. IV. i. 4, Sed
uxor scelesta, ‘but that jade, my wile,' where Weise is quite mistaten.
In this sense the epithet may be applied to things as well as persons,
as in the line immediately following the one quoted above, Sceleslae
hac sunl aedes, ‘ guilt attaches to this mansion 3’ and in ΙΙΙ. i. 1, Sce-
leslrbrem ego annum, ac, ‘never did 1 see a more villainous year lor
leading out money;’ and this use ol or'llatitaus is common in our own
language. Scelesacs is also employed to denote craft or subtlety
rather than actual guilt, as in Trin. ΙΙ, iv. 126, elsi scelestus esl At mc'
rirfidelr's non erl, ‘although the fellow is a cunning rogue, yet he is
not uniaithlul to me ;’ it is used also playfully‚ as in the line besore
ua, and so sceleste, Most. 11. ii. 47, where the reading is doubtful, means
‘you rascal,’ but without any serious emphasis. a. As if to indicate
the due connection between crime and misery, scelestus passes into ,
the sense ol nu’suable, and isused without necessarily implying guilt
at all, in the sense of ‘unhappy‘ or ‘unfortunate’ So below, ΙΙΙ. i. 3⁶
( 33), nae ega sum mrsu, Sceleslus, namt dis caturcis amardus. One who

was unlucky or unfortunate might be regarded as punished by the
gods sor some crime; and this seems to be indicated in the above
passage, and also in Capt. 111. v. 104, Eun. 11. iii. 34, and As. V.
ii. 6, Al rcclcsla ega praeter alus mcum orcumsui rata Scirum, frugi,
conlabentem, amantem uxorr's utaxume, ‘wretched beyond others;'
