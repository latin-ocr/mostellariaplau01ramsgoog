246 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA. y

111. Nemus r. Il'umur urgenti. It will be seen from the examples
quoted above that the word Numus is occasionally used with re· ,
rerence ιο ue mappas, mr n ms case ue aunone am (οι '
Philippus) is usually combined with it, and where these are omitted,
as in Bac. 1v. iv. 55, 58, viii. 27, 32, ix. 110, Poen 111. ii 17, Trin. v
IV. ii. 128, 161, the contextis such as to leave no doubt that tbe
Philippus is meant

But there are several passages in Plautus in which memus cannot
mean the ππππω aureus or Philippus, indeed the designation rum
argentiis by no means uncommon, e. g. As. 11. iv. 80, argenti numm
Aul. Ι. ii. 30, argentimcmos: cf. 1¹·345 Pseud. 1. 'u952 numus argenti,-

iii. 65, numum urgenti.

ln such cases it is difficult to discover what sum is indicated.
Moreover doubts have arisen whether the same sum or coin is
uniformly indicated by Nemus, and also whether the word is em·
ployed with reference to Greek or to Roman currency.

r. Itis used for money in general, or pieces of money, without
special reference to any particular sum or coin: thus Bac. lv. iv. 17,
Num qut nunu· exciderunt, here, tr'br', quod sic terram Optuere? ‘you
have not dropped some pieces of money, master, have youf' and so
As. 11. iv. 34, adducit (sc. trapezetam) domum etrum ultro, et sm'br't
numos, ‘draws a bill upon him!

2. Numus or Numus argentiis used to denote a triding sum:
thus Capt. 11. ii. 82, Eum si reddis mihi, praeterea unum mentum ne
duri, ‘if you restore to me my son, do not give me a single shilling
in addition (for your ransom). In Pers. IV. iv. 111 memus adesse hinc
non potest means, ‘1 won't take a shilling less3’ just as we had above
quoted from Rud. V. ii. 43, non potest triobolum mm abesse,· so also
in Most. I. ii. 34 (31), si quid numo sarciri potest, ‘if any defect mn
be repaired for a trifle3' cf. Pseud. 1. i. 79, iii. 122, v. 91, Il. ii 49,

V. ii. 24; in Epid. V. ii. 35, where the slave offers to take heavy
odos, he says, ni ergo matris filiu est, In nuum numum, in taran
talentum, pigrus da, ‘1 bet you a numus to a taient ς’ and so 111. i. 9.

3. But there can be no doubt that Numus is frequently used to
indicate a piece of money of definite value: thus in Epid. 1. i. 5²
Stratippocles is represented as having borrowed a sum of money
at Thebes from an usurer, for which he was to pay at the rate of
a numus per day for each minas· in Men. 11. ii. 16, 37, a numm is
named as the price of a young pig frt for sacrifice (porci sacres ,
sr'rrcrri); in Epid. ΙΙΙ ii. 36 Epidicus proposes to hire the services f
of a fidicina for a numus; in Pers. IV. vi. 2, when a sum of sixty
