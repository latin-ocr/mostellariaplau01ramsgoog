in which it was eventually superseded by e. Among these we lind
Tortores sor Tmores, Quintil. Ι. v. aa 3 Amploclv' 101 Amplectr', Prisc.
15510111101101. [11183. The latter gives Amploclere, Vertere,
Advorsum, and Convellere, Votore 101 Convellere, Velare. Charis. p. 174,
gives loturos 101 l'elorvhs, and this receives some support lrom the
inscriptions, nn. 1019, 1057, 1082, in which the letters VOT. are usually
interpreted to referto the Tribus Veturio. Volr‘lom 101 Velr‘lorn is
quoted lrom Plaut As. lV. i. 44 by Nonius, p. 453 Vole'rn 101 Velim,
⁴ Prisc. p. 848.

Judging 11011 the examples preserved, the form undae instead oi
endere was general in gerundives 01 the third and fourth conjugatione
until towards the close 01 the Republic. Thus we lind DE-
FERVNDO, DEICVNDO, FACIVNDVM lis, LEGVNDEIS,
LEGVNDIS, QVAERVNDAI, SCRIBVNDI [12], VENDVN-
DEIS [14 lis], LEGVNDEIS [lo le's], REFERVNDVM [17],
cnPwNDms [18 ler]‚ DEIVIDVNDA bis, ERCEISCVNDA
bis [19], REFERVNDVM sexies, REFlCIVNDVM, FACIVN·
DVM [20]; SAEPIVNDVM, n1419; VENIVNDVM,‘n 1431,
and so in many other inscriptions, which may be fairly rechoned as
falling within the above limit

This 10111 however did not prevail to the exclusion 01 that in mdes,
101 we find FACIENDAM, EXDEICENDVM‚ as early as 10, and
COLENDI [13]. Observe also that erden is employed uniformly
in those verbs where the use ol the termination undas would have
involved the introduction 01 ure: thus TRIBVENDEI [12]‚
FRVENDVS, FRVENDVM, F RVENDA quinquies, FRVENDEIS
[14]‚ FRVENDEIS [10].

“Etiam optem neaxr'rnue ut mediam I literam, quae veteribus
V iuerat, acciperent, C. primum Caesaris inscriptione traditur fac·

however confined to ptumus, 1111111111, but extended to all super-
latives which in later times were written with 1111111. Thus PARI-
SVMA [1], PLOIRVME, OPTVMO [8], FACILVMED [10],
