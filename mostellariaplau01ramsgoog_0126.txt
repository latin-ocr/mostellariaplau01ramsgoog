Marna nnn enosonv.
Mil. 111. i. aa (τιοιι. retr. eac),

lepidiorem ad omnes res, nec qui amalus amato sr't magam
Cist. V. 1 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Quid hoc negoh' esf quod omnes homthes fabulantur per urbm,
where quid hoc also is a monosyllable.

Ergo. Autem Quippe. But although the principle of shortening
certain common words in pronunciation may be fairly admitted in
the worda enumerated above, it hasbeen extended to others upon

very feeble and imperfect evidence. Such are crgo, auten, qar'ppe,

tahud perhaps some others, but we shall be content with examining
ese.

Auem isone of the words which it was held might be pronounced
as a pyrrich, atim, with the first short, as if it were mem, or
‘correptim,' that is, as a monosyllable; but although Lindemann
seems to acquiesce in this (Ad Trin. 11. ii 52), he admits else·
where (De Prosodia Pl. p. xxiv.) that only one satisfactory example
can be adduced: Stich 1. iii. 60 (Senem),

Quot potiones muin': quot uitem prandea,

a reading which is retained by W, who remarks, “Luculentum hoc .

exemplum correpti auum ab initio. Cf. et Amph. Prol 36, Mero. 11.
ili. 85, Mil. HL i. 84, Pers. V. i. 113³ There is no doubt that

in the above passage all the MSS, including A, have autem,-
Brixius, who is followed by R., corrects item In Mil. 111. i 84 the
MSS. are corrupt and the reading is very uncertain In Amph.
Ptol 36, W. has got into confusion, for while in his note he
speaks of mrtem as pronounced ‘correptim,' his text (which is here

’ the Vulgata) presente no difficulty-

Iusto autem ad thrireh'e praeimpenso esf,

although he says that petere is not to be elided In fact, he seenm
to have lorgotten that the last syllable of auum is elidad before ab.
See his accentuation. Mero. 11. iii. 85 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Lr'tr'gare nolo ego vos, neqrre mam aakm amari fidant

is another of the examples given by W, but surely the simple Vll
to acan the line is to sinlr mum-

uratgare ι urvo aga ι aas naqa ιι W alenam sutem.

Nothing can be asserted positively as to the measure of Pers V. i. ιι.
On the whole, as Lindemann observes, the whole doctrine of wem.
