Trapcsita. Goeller, Lindemann, and Ritschl would allow the
second syllable in Trapesiia to be short, on the authority of Trin. 11.
iv. 23 (senaa),

Trapesiioe malle drachmarum Olympicum,

in which they suppose the first foot to be au Anapaest. B has
drachumarm· C, D, E, drahmehorum; but A has the common
form drachmanon. But although the first syllable iu drachma must
belong, it by no means follows that the first syllable iu drachumo
is also long ; on the contrary, we should be justified in asserting
that it must be short, for the Greek δραχμῆ is naturally short, and
accordingly being followed by the aspirated mute χ and the liquid μ
appears as short in Aristop. Plut, 884,
Τὸν δακτύλιον rovhl παρ’ Εὐδάμου δρᾶχμῆς.

Hence all difficulty asto the scansion of the above line vanishes, and
it is unnecessary to have recourse to the expedient of pronouncing
mille as amonosyllable. In other passages of Plautus trapezeta has
uniformly its proper quantity, e. g. Asin. 11. iv. ga, Capt I. ii. 90,
ΙΙ. iii. 89, Cure. 11. iii. 62, 66, ΙΙΙ. 36, 50, 1v.iv. 3, V. ii. ao,

iii 34, 43, Pseud. II. iv. 67.
Philippus, Philippeia, Philippicas. The case of these words is

peculiar, and demands special notice. They occur upwards of
thirty times in Plautus with reference to gold coin, and in every
instance, except perhaps one, to be noticed below, the two first

syllables are to be pronounced as one-Phlppm, Phlippeus, (phi.
lippeus however does not occur in nominative sing.) This cannot
be occidental, but must have resulted from the ordinary pronun·
ciation of the word, for the form Phiiippus would be quite as ser-
viceable in an Iambic or Trochaic line as Ptlppus. hgain, Philippeia,
Phth'ppeo, Philippei, ac, seem sometimes pronounced as trisyllables,
Ptrppats, tec, but more frequently as dissyllables‚ Phlippis, tec,
never as tetrasyllables, Philippiis. Phdppicunt occurs once only,
and must be pronounced Phlippicum. Thus Poen. I. iii. 6 (senaa),

Trecentos Phlippos Colluhisco aalide ,·
Bac. tv. ix. 83 (senaa),
Pol haud derides, nam ducentii aureis
Philippis redemi velam ex flagelio iream,⁸

viii. ay (Senam), ᾔ
’ Nunc nisi ducenti Phihppi redduntur mt'hi,· ,
