too confined. In 1819 a tract was published by Lingius, afterwards ·
Rector of the Gymnasium oi Hirschberg, in silesia, entitled De He'alee
e'n Versibus Plautinis, written with great good sense and moderatiori,
in which, after a curesul examination, he endeavours to classify the
different examples oi hiatus found in Plautus, and to distinguish
those which are common from those which are more rare, and to
specify cases in which, according to his vicus, hiatus is altogether
inadmissible. Although the limits which he assigns are so wide as
to comprehend avast number of examples, and practically it will be
found very difficult, if not impossible, to fix upon any limits stall, yet
we shall have no difficulty in enumerating the different cases in which
ῃ the licence, if we can call it so, is most common, and in which there is
no reasonable ground for altering the text on this account alone.
1. Long Monosyllebles. In these elision is freely neglected. The

Aen. VI. 507,
Nomen etormet locunt sonant, te, amieo, nequivi.

Molestus ne sis .· nunc iam irus, te ΙΙ amove.

Mil. ΙΙ. vi. 88,
Noetu hercle, si te dt ΙΙ amant, Ir'reguam eomprentes.

Phorm. Prol. η,

Mil. IV. viii. 4, ι

P. Quid vti? Pr. Quin (tu) iubes ecferri omnia qreoe ΙΙ e’ste‘ dedi.

2. The Penthenn'meral Caesura in lambio Trimeters. Hiatus is
exceeding common in this place: thus Pseud. 1. i. 24,

Interprelore' ΙΙ aleient posse nernt'nent,

which is the reading os all the MSS„ including A.

Rud P¹⁰¹· 7’ lum mortales ambulo ΙΙ eitterdries.
