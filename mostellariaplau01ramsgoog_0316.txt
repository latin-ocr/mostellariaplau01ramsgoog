NOTES. V. i. 4, 5-ii. 32. 173

sale of a free Greek damsel 'to a leno under the pretext that she
had been hidnapped and brought from the most remote regions of
Arabia, the terms on which sheis offered for sale expressly exclude
mancupaut (IV. iii. 55), Ac suo periclo e's eneat, quicum mercabatur,
Mancupia neque promittet, neque qut'squam dabat, and therefore Dor-
dalus at first objects to the proposal, ΝιἸιιῚ mebi opus est Lr'tz'bus queque
tricis: quamobrem ego argentum numeremsoras? Nisi maneuptb accepia,
quid eo naabi opus mercabaom‘o? but when he is at last persuaded he is
reminded (iv. 40), Prius dz’co hanc mancupio nemo abitabit, and after
the price has been settled, v. 113, Tuo penato sexaginta haec datur
argenti mihin· and when eventually the trick is disclosed he is obliged
to acquiesce in the loss of his money, glad to escape a prosecution
for trafficleing in free maidens. So in lllerc. II. iii. ιη, Charinus en·
deavotus to avoid selling Pasicompsa by urging that he has no legal
title, Nou ego e'llam maneaepio accepi. See Cure. IV. ii. 8, V. ii. 193
Bac. l. i. 59 uti me mancupo, ‘l make myself over to you absolutely ;'
and so Mil Ι. 23. ,

3²· Hic ego tibi praesuledo: ne aitterbitat quaestio] ie. ‘lest the
examination should fall throuth i. e. ‘should fail,’ where ahterbitat
is equivalent to ahtereat. The simple verb bito, which seems to have
the same force as eo, both as a simple verb and in composition, is
found once or twice in Plautus. Thus Curc. 1. ii. 51, Qui me in terra
aeque fortunatus erit, si illa ad me buu· and Mero. 11. iii. 127, Aa
portum ne bitus,d1'co tam tibi. C. Auseaeltabr'tur. Bitat in Mil. IV.
ii. 7 is a conj. emend.; so also be'tere in Pseud. l. iii. 23· We find
also several compounds3 Capt 11. iiieo, Sinon rebitas huc, ut ui·
gaittr'mehas Dem pro te (rebv'las=redeas),· 111. iv. 72, Namque edepol si
adbites proprias os deusabe't uti (adbe'tes=adibr's); Rud. ΙΙ. vi. ιι, Vtinam
te peries quatu omlis uzdassem mah, Malo crucaatu a'n Sa'ct'leam perbi-
teres (ie. pera'res); Stich. IV. ii. 28, Non it, non it, quea tanto opere
suadesne ebetat, where ebttat would be admissible; Pseud. lll. i.

Poen. V. iii. 44, Α. Quid, si eamus allah abaciam? H. At ne ahter uias
Praeterbitamus, metuas where praterbitamus would be admissible. In
anthe above passages except two the penultimate of bito must be
long3 in the 'two excepted the long quantity is equally admissible‚
and therefore there can beyno doubt as to the quantity* Nonius,

* There is yet another example in Plautus, viz. aditet, which is quoted
by F reund as abito: the line is in Rud. Ill. iv. 72, Hunc quoque adserva
ipsam, ne quo abitur, nam promisimus, which is a Troch. Tetr. Cat, and
scansion demands that we should pronounce abitat.
