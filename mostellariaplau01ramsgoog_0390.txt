EXCVRSVS XIV-TALENTVM, llllNel, dv. 247

minae are pald over, two numi are deducted as the value of the bag
(crumeno); in Men. 1. iv. 1 Erotium gives Cylindrus three numito
purchase viands for aprondium; in Trin. IV. ii. 1 the Sycophanta
says, Huic ego diei norrea trinumosaciizm, nom ego operam meam Tribus
numu hodsi locavi ad artes nugatorias, with which compare ua. 6, 153.
The passage in Most. 11. i. ιο will be examined below.

There is nothing in any of the above examples from which we
could with certainty infer the precise value of the Numm. Some
light however is thrown upon the inquiry by the speech of the coolr,
in Pseud. III. ii. 20, who complains that when people went to the
market to hire a coolr, they loohed out not for the best artiste but
for the cheapest: hence, he exclaims‚ Hoc-ego sui hodie solus opsessor
sori, Illi drachmis* issent miseri, me nemo polest Minoris qusiqsmm
numo† ul surgam subigere,- cf. Aul. ΙΙΙ. ii. 34, Pseud. Ill. ii. 58, 87.
This proves conclusively that the Nu'mus was more in value than the
Dracbnm But we can go farther; in Truc. 11. iv. 91 Dinarchus
declares that he will expend a llius on viands for Phronesium,
Praeterea opsonari dumtaxat od minam, and in vii. 11, Geta, who
had been employed to lay out the money, gives, in a soliloquy, an
account of his stewardship, reJ'oicing that he had not failed to talre
good care of himself, Nom tom de hoc opsonio dr mna una deminui
Modo qm'nqur numos, nite· detraxi partem Herculaneum. But the
Pars Hermiones (see note on Most. IV. iii. 45) was a tithe, there-
fore live numi were one-tenth os a Μὺια, and since a Mina=100
Drachmae, five numi must have been equal to 10 Brachmue, and
hence a Numus was equal to two Drachmae or a Dsiirachm.

This value of the Numus will suit perfectly the passages quoted
above, and those also in which considerable sums are mentioned.
In Rud. V. iii. 50 Labrax says that he paid a thousand Numi (atille
numos denumeravi) for Ampelisca, but according to the above corn· ·
putation 1000 Numi would be 20 Μὴιαι, which was an ordinary

price for a female slave (see note on Most. 1. iii. 142),and so 600
Numi, or ra dianae, is the price of a female slave of an inferior
description in Pers. I. 'a 37, iii. 37, 111. iii. 32, V. ii. 70. Mille
numos is found in Rud. V. ii. 40, where the context proves that the
sum was considerably less than a talent;¹ and mille aurnum occurs in
Merc 11. iv. 23, but here the context does not enable us to fix even
an approximate value for the amount indicated.

* ln Merc. IV. iv. 37 a cook demands adrachma as his hire for a day.
† lt is almost unnecessary to observe that the explanation given by some
of the older commentators “ numo aureo Romano '⁹ is altogether absurd.
