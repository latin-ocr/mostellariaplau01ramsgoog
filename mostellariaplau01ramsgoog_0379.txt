nrinio is not an adverb, but the‘ablative of mbu'us with argento or
some such word understood, ‘the house does not appear to you to
have been purchased at too long a price, does itl'

Nr'mrb used as an adverb seems not to occur in Terence.

xl11.-SODES,SIS pl. S VLTIS, AMABO, QVAESO,
OBSECRO.

These five words are employed by the dramatists iu the sense ol
‘pray,’ ‘prithee,' ‘if you please,' ‘1 beg os you,' ‘I beseech you‚’
⁴1 implore you' We may make a few remarks upon each.

, Ι. Sodes was regarded by the Romans themselves as a con·
traction oi si audes: thus Cic. Orat. XLV. ξ 154, artarer chhrrr
copulando verba iungebant, ut ‘sodes’ pro ‘siaudesl ‘sis' pro ‘sivis,·'
and Festus, s. v. sutrii, p. 343, ed. Mul, “Sulh's, sr' voltis signifioet,
composito vocabulo, ita utalia sunt, rodes, si audes, sis, si vis: &c

ς The uncontracted form is found Trin. 11. i. 17, Da milri toc, nul
marm, sime amas, siaudes,· and in Aul. 11. i. 48, as the line is quoted
by Priscian, p. 960, ed. Puts, Dic nubi, ri audes, quis ea est quam vis
ducere retorem? where however our MSS. ol Plautus give quaeso
instead of si audo.

Generally speaking, sodes is used without much emphasis: thus
Bac. IV. vii. 39, C. Novistine hominem) N. Novi. C. Dr'c sodes
mihi, Bellun' videturrpecie rnulr'er? N. Admodum, ie. ‘pray, tell me,’ ’
or ‘tell me, ii you please ;' aud so Men. 111. iii 21, Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 161,
Pers. II. v. 17.

It is a formula os civility in Hec. V. i. 27, sed scin quid volo potius
seder sacries? ie. ‘if it so plesse you;’ and so Heaut. 1v. iv. 16,
Phor. V. vii. 28. ·

There is considerable earnestness in Adel. lV. v. 9, dic mdes,
pater, ‘tell me,1 entreat you ;’ and in Hec. V. iv. 1, Vide, mi Par·
meno, etrum seder, i. e. ‘pray, be careiul3' while there is something
soothing or deprecatory in Phor. V. iii. 10, Parce sodcs; and coaring

‚in Poen. III. v. 12, Mitte ud me sodes, irc, and in Trin. Il. i. 11· 1

For other examples oi sodes sce Adel IV. i. 1, Andr. 1. i 58, ³
Heaut. 111. i. 50, iii. 19, IV. iv. 16, v.'22, Hec. 111. ii. 23, V. iv. 4,
Phor. V. i. 14. See also Catull. CIII. 1, Cic. Epp. ad Arc VII. 3,
Hor. S. l. ix. 41, Epp. 1. i. ⁶2, vii. 15, XVI. 31, Ad Pisones 438.

It will be observed from the above examples that sodes usually
follows an imperative, but this is not the case invariably, as may be
