Mil. 11. iv. 26 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),
Nec fenestra m'sf clatratae-Nam certo ego te hic titius utili,

where W. reads nec, R. neque, without remark ; Ba has fenetra, A and
all the rest, fenestra. Clatrata or clathratais aconjectural emendation ;
A has neque clarat& all the rest, nisi clarata. We learn however
from Macrobius, S. 111. 12, that there was an old Latin word sestra
used by Ennius, the precise meaning of which was a subject of dis-
cussion in the age of Cicer0‚ and which was interpreted to signify
orbum mriercsculunt, while Paul. Diae. p. 91, ed. Mul, says expressly,
“Fesfram antiqui dicebant quam nos smstram,·'' llltlller in his note
says, “ Corrupte Placidus, p. 464: Frestram, fenestram.” and refers to
Doederlein, Syn. et Etym, Tom. vl. p. 127, q. v. Fertrant is quoted
from Petronius als0, Frag. xxi. 6, but there it is a conjectural emen·
dation for sestam of the MSS. There can be little doubt therefore
that Bothe was fully justified in substituting sestra for serresfra in the
passages quoted above. The word sestra or fenestra does not, ap-
parently, occur elsewhere in Plautus

Invideo, Ingemitnt. We have aline in Terent. Andr. l. i. 39 (senar),

Sine thusdrit laudem tituem'as, e! amr'cos pares,

where B. “Ceterum savium primam hic corripit ut pote positione
tantum longam: sono literae I hic exili: adde quod in primo versus
pede maior concessa sit licentia. Sic thgcmicm primam corripit,
111. i 8'’ (senar),

Bonum rirgemitm narrar adulescentis- Optumum.

The tme explanation is the same in both cases; εἰπε and bonum
being words which may be pronounced as monosyllables, are in these
passages altogether elided

Intro. The following examples of intro have been quoted: Aul.
⁸ 111. iii. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Ile rane nunc iam inho omnes et coci et tr'br'cinac,

but it is much more simple to regard sitm as amonosyllable elided
before titire, ll. viii. aa (Senon),

bimatum occtilor nt'sr' ego intro huc propero currere,

but even thus the line will not scan unless we read nr' for nisi or sinlr
ego altogether. Gulielmus and others, relying upon a MS, insert
premere before propero, thus transforming the line into a Troch. Tetr.
Cat, but the whole of this scene is composed of Senarians. Stich.
IV. i. ²9 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Deis salutatum alque uxorem niodo titlro devoror (fontum.
