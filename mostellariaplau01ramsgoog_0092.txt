and Most. 111. i. 55,
D. Iam hercle ego illunc nominabo. ΙΙ Τ. Euge! strenua·

and again ii. ιιι (109), in a Bacchiae Tetr,
Vt allas remelini sibi. ΙΙ T n. Haud opinor.

6. All exclamatione, ahtershcn'ons, inprecatione, ond the like, are
exempted from elision, as they are indeed from all the ordinary
rules ol prosody. Aul. 11. viii. aa,

Perii hercle! ΙΙ aurum rapitur! aula quoeralur.

We must repeat, however, that we would not confine the neglect
of elision to the particular eases specified above. We would merely
point out that it oeeurs frequently under these circumstances, and

when encountered need excite no suspicion with regard to the
genuineness ol the text.

Rule eff Postb'on.

a But alter these obstacles have been cleared away, the chief
difficulty remains untouched. Aa soon as scholars began to tum
their attention to the metres oi Plautus and Terence, they found
a great number of lines which apparently could not be scanned at
all without violating the Rule os Position, which may be said to lie
at the very foundation os Latin prosody. We shall quote several
of these lines, selecting as examples those which belong to the
kinds ol verse whose structure is well ascertained and in which

there is no evident corruption ol the text.
Bentley, in his celebrated &anama de Matris Termltbm's, admits

the facts as in many cases indipputable, and points out that his
