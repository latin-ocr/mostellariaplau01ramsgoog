xviii PROLEGOMENA.

writers is frequently so corrupt that it is impossible to determine
their actual meaning. Oi this we have a conspicuous example in
the earliest grammatica} essay which has come down to us, viz. the
lines os Lucilius upon the termination El, which are in such con·

’ fusion that it is impossible to elicit any satisfactory signification from

them without having recourse to anumber oi conjectural emendations
Not that we would reject the evidence ol the grammarians in a mass.
All that we lind in Quintilian is worthy of the most serious attention,
and may for the most part be accepted without hesitation. The
authority oi Priscian also is considerable, although he is by no means
a guide that can be entirely depended upon; but the lower we
descend the less trustworthy do the authorities become, and their
evidence cannot be accepted except when corroborated by other
sources oi information.

In order to give an idea os the small reliance tbat can be placed
upon the statements oi the ancient grammarians in matters ol ortho-
graphy, we may briefly examine their assertions with regard to the
doubling ol consonante.

In cases where the same word occurs written sometimes with a
single, sometimes with a double consonant, it may be difficult to
decide with certainty which is the original form, but the presumption
will always be that the more simple form is also the most ancient.
Since no word or syllable can either begin or end with a doubled
consonant, it follows that wherever doubled consonante occur they
must stand between two vowels‚ except in the case ol certain com·
pound words. But some of the old grammarians maintained that
a doubled consonant could not be admitted except alter a short
vowel. Thus Comut. ap. Cass. p. 2283 (ed Putsb.):

‘⁴ Causa per unam S, nec quemquam moveat antiqua scriptura,
nam et acnusare per duo SS scripserunt, sicut sarire, debr‘sissc, esse et
ramasse per duo SS scriptum invenio. In qua enuntiatione quo·
modo duarum consonantium sonus exaudiatur, non invenio.'' He

then goes outo give vostra anacampseroten, votare (vetare),
norim, convolvere, amploctere, as examples ol archaic spelling out
ol date in his time.

Compare with this Mar. Victorin. p. 2456: “Est itaque in principio

dicendum quemadmodum antiqui scripserint, dehinc quid nunc de·
beamus observare. Consonantes literas non geminabant ut in bis
Amas, Lucullus, Memmius, et cetera bis similia, sed supra literam
quam geminari oportebat scilicet sicilicum imponebant euius figura
baec est, quoderat signum geminandi, sicut apparet in mulus
