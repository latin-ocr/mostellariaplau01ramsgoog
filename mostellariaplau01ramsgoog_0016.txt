PREFACE. ix

but which, from the evidence of inscriptions, Mr. Ramsay held
himself entitled to conclude were in all probability actually
employed by Plautus himself. I have preferred to exhibit an
orthography all but identical with that presented by the most
distinguished of the recent critics, especially Ritschl and Fleck-
eisen, and which, so far as the Mostellaria is concerned, is to
be found in an excellent form in the edition of that play by Aug.
Lorenz (1866), forming part of the Haupt and Sauppe classica.
‘Almost all the peculiarities which distinguish that ortho-
graphy have been sanctioned by Mr. Ramsay, and have been
therefore incorporated in the text. Thusp has been uniformly
substituted for b before s or t, as in apstinere, optinere, and the
like, ue (vo) is uniformly written for ue (vu), except in the
words teum and suum, where, in deference to the authority of
Ritschl, Ι have retained the familiar mode of spelling:
ο is written for e in voster, verto and its compounds; optumus,
maxum, emente, etc. is written for optime, etc.; p is in all
cases inserted between mand either s or t following, while the
spellings faenus, caenum, adulescens, gnarus (the noun), and others
for which there is good MS. authority, are adopted throughout.
But, for the reasons above stated, I have refrained from
substituting eis for is in datives and ablatives plural of the
first and second declensions, and from writing uniformly es in
all plural cases of the third, although Mr. Ramsay holds it to
be an older form than either is or eis,· nor have Ι ventured to

write quei, sei, quasei, ibet, uber', coivit, deice, etc., though in all ,

those cases it can be shewn from inscriptions that the longer
form was that more commonly employed in the time of Plautus.

It will be seen from the Prolegomena that the evidence of
inscriptions proves as certainly as that of MSS, that in many
cases uniformity of spelling did not prevail until a corn-

paratively late peri0d3 we see the rival forms side by side
in the same inscriptions, and we cannot doubt that in such
cases both forms were in use together, and that it was only
gradually and aster a long conflict that the older forms gave
