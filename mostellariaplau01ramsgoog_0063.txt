and Marius Victorin. (p. 2458), agree that we ought to write sed and
not set, because the word is an abbreviation of the ancient sedam.
The words of Victorinus are, “Antiqui pro reri, cedron scribebant, sed
quum nostra aetas partem literarum in eo reservarit, partem, brevitatis
causa, ex eo detraxerit, nonnullam immutarit, et nos per red quam
per set scribamus;'' where observe that he says umbrosanum scri-
demas: a few lines before he had observed, “ sed nos nunc et ahenam
et aprtd per D potius quam per T scribamus, omentum et apur.”

Again, the earne Victorinus (p. 2462) derives haud from oi, and lays
it down as a rule that it ought to be written houd when the word
following begins with a vowel, as houd aperilem, but haut when the
word following begins with a consonant, as lou! pluuium but this

must be regarded as an opinion of what ought to be done, not as
the record of an established usage. The forms haud and haut were
probably both in common use when Victorinus composed his treatise;
and he sought to establish a distinction as to their use. Ritschl
(Proleg. XCIX, Q), who has a pet theory of his own with regard to
the form lou, which mayor may not have been occasionally enr-
ployed* reconstructs the above passage, and endeavours to convince
us that the precept which Victorinus intended to incurate was that
we ought to write haud before a vowel and hau before a consonent.

But without attempting to penetrate farther into the thomy thicket
of these grammatical speculatione, it may be stated as a fact that the
forms At, Aput, Set, Alnus, Haut, for Ad, Apud, Sed, Aliud, Haud, and
also It, Qait, Quot, for Id, Qm'd, Quod, occur not unfrequently in
inscriptions and the oldest MSS, and hence Bentley has admitted
Aput, Set, Haut, into the text of his Terence, while Ritschl adopts
these and also aliid and illut. But although it is certain that in later
times t was frequently substituted for d in many, if not all, of the ten
words above enumerated‚ the real question which we have now to
consider is whether there is any evidence to prove that this was the
case in the earlier period of the language. If we examine the whole
of the twenty inscriptions on which we chiefly rely, and even extend
our researches into the whole of those which are ranked in the great
work of Mommsen as belonging to sn epoch anterior to the death
of Caesar, we shall arrive at the following result:

AD occurs upwards of ninety times3

AT, never in the inscriptions 1-20, but once in n. 1252, an

* We lind an in an inscription, n. 1007, Mommsen, but tlre
original tablet has long since disappeared, and the reading of the word
isby no means certain.
