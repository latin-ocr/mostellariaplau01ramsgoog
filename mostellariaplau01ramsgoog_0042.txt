ORTHOGRAPHY. xxiii

III. Inscriptr‘ons.

By sar the most reliable and authoritative evidence on questions
of early Latin orthography is ufforded by inscriptions. The only
sources ol lallacy, in so sar as inscriptions are concerned, may be
classed under four heads:

1. The mistalres made by the original engravers on the stone or
metsl.

a. The mistalres made by the scholars who have transcribed
them.

3. The difficulty os ascertaining the exact period at which they
were engraved.

4. The genuineness ol the inscn'ptions themselves. ·

The mistalres made by the engravers are lor the most part obvious,
are not numerous, and but few of them effect the questions under
consideration.

The great care taken and exertions made by modern scholars to
arrive at perfect accuracy in representing the originals, has in a great
measure removed any difficulties which might have embmrassed one
from this quarter. Still the necessity ol care is rendered obvious by
the errors pointed out, and the corrections introduced by each new
copyist, and the difficulty of arriving at absolute accuracyis proved
by the variations-trilling it is true, but still variations-presented in
almost all the different editions ol the inscription on the tomb of
the Scipios. So also in transcribing hom the original capitals into
ordinary type, the eye and hund, however practised, will sorne-
times fail.

In the mse ol almost all the inscriptions we have selected and
enumerated below, the date is clearly ascertained, within very narrow
limits, by internal evidence.

The genuineness ol only one ol the series has been seriously
impugned by Maffei, but the concurrent testimony of scholars is in
its favour.

[To the evidence ol inscriptions, therefore, so lar as these will
serve us, we must betalre ourselves in the first instance, is we desire‘
to arrive at any certain knowledge as to those archaic forms by
which we must suppose the spelling of Plautus to have differed from
that of the later writers. In all cases where we can collect hom
genuine inscriptions a sufficient number ol undoubted instances to
justisy tbe inference that a particular mode ol spelling either a single
