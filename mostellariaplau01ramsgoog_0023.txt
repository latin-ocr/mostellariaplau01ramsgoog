above named; and although many oi the conjectural emendations
were in themselves ingenious and plausible, yet on the whole the text
ql Plautus was more encumbered with a load os foreign matter and
more deformed than even in the Editio Princeps.

But a new era dawned in 1552, when a complete edition oi the
twenty plays was published at Leipsic by Joacbim Camerarius, who
bad previously published (Lips. 1545) five pieoes, and subsequently
(Lips. 1549) six more. ·

Camerarius had obtained possession of two MSS. unknown to
previous editors.

One ol these contained the whole twenty plays, and is generally
known among critics as the Vetus Codex Camerarri', in consequence
of being older than any then known

The other is very frequently referred to as the Codex Drmiam,
because although it had originally contained the whole twenty, the
first eight had been torn off and had disappeared before it came into
the hands of Camerarius. Both of these, the first especially, proved
of the highest value‚ and by their aid, combined with his own re·
markable acuteness and good sense, Camerarius, who thorougbly
understood his author, and was deeply imbued with his spirit and
phraseology‚ was enabled to elaborate atext irnmeasurably superior
to any that had been previously given to the world He could say
with justice when be entered upon his taslr-“ Si ullum cuiusquam
opus miserabiliter depravatum et corruptum scelerate fuit, hoc pro·

veteri libro in Plautinis comoediis restituta sibi fuerunt, tam in verbis
quam numeris versuum, de quorum integritate nihil etiam dubii iam
nobis relinquitur. Ac possem annumerare non &addar neque ἑκατον-
τάδας, sed plane yantas, si ostentare operam nostram vellemus, sed
pauperis est numerare pecus ;'’ and when it was completed he was
able to boast without vainglory-“ vere ac simpliciter affirmare
possum vix ullum versum, de quo non aliquid, certe paginam nnllam
esse, de qua non plurimum mendorum sublatum sit”

Not only did Camerarius collate these MSS. with so much care
and accuracy that when eagcrly scrutinized by subsequent scholars
wonderfully few mistalres were detected and omissions supplied, but in
consequence oi his natural acuteness and his thorough acquaintance
with the spirit and phraseology oi Plautus, the greater number of bis
