lxiv PROLEGOMENA.

several of these cannot be scanned without conjectural emendations
more or less violent-

υ. 94. Molossus followedby two Bacchii, but unless we pronounce
the word congrediar as a trisyllable, and regard the line as Catalectic,
we must have recourse to some such conjectura] emendation as
that proposed by W. and R. who read congredior.

v. 95. Molossus in rst.

are-
Sed is maestus esl se hasce vendidisse,

Sed ul mactus est sc hasce vendidisse.

v. 108. Molossus in rst. Philolacheti pronounced Phlolacleti.
a.109. Pure. There is an hiatus between sibi and haud but
this can scarcely be objected to by the most fastidious, since there

is achange of person.

Ξ. fif. {umere the first syllable in redhibere being regarded as long.

v. 112. Can only be scanned by resolving the last syllable of the
