EXCVRSVS 1V.-IMO. ’ 201

pessumum In deneganda mode quis pudor paululum adest, ‘is it really
true, (you will ask, that there are such persons. Yes, there are, but
bad as these are whom Ι have described, they are not the worst sort
· of people:) no, the worst are those who' dec, and then he proceeds
to characterize a class.

111. ln certain cases r‘rno may be translated ‘yes,’ but this happens
only when r'nre is used in reply to a negative proposition, and where
‘yes' is in reality equivalent to ‘on the contrary ;' Aul. 111. vi. 9,
E. Neque, pol, Megadare, ner‘hr' neque cuiquam pauperi Oprire'em meltius
rer structa est demi. M. Imo est, et Disaeianl uli sr'et, tec: here e'nro
contradicts the negative proposition introduced by neque, ‘yes it is
(ie. on the contrary, it is, hc.) ;' Bac. ΙΙ, iii. 81, N. Sedeas m'lrr'lne
adhelr'str's inde aurr‘ domum? C. Into, rerumrerum wantum adtulerit
nescu: here eirea refers to nihil, ‘have you not brought any gold
honre from thencei' ‘lies we have (i. e. on the contrary, we have),
even now, but how much I know not ;’ Hec. II. i. 31, S. Nan nua
operamque pol aelpa eveur't. L. Ima maxume: here imo refers to
nen . . . neque, ‘yes, (i. e. on the contrary) it did, in the highest degree ;'
Adel. 11. ii. 39, S. Num quid uis quin abeam? Ima hercle hoe quaeso,
Sure: ‘You don’t want anything, do you, to hinder me from going
awayl’ S. ‘Yes, (on the contrary,1 do want something) Ι have to
beg of you' &c.; Hec. V. iv. 35, Pau. Nereis, Parmeno, Quantum
hodie profueris mr'hr', el ex quanm aerumna extraxeris. Pan. Ima vero
scio: neque hee inprudens feei: ‘Yon don’t know! ‘Yes‚ (on the con·
trary‚) 1 do know very well:’ or we might translate, ‘no, I am not
ignorant, I do know well;’ Cas. 11. vi. 30, Stalino, Chalinus, and
Olympio are wrangling before proceeding to cast lots: S. Quod
benum atque fortunatum mr‘lre'sil. 0. Ita vere etmihi. C. Neu. O. Ima
hercle. C. Ima milri terea Stalino having prayed that the result
may be fortunate for himself, Olympio adds, ‘be it sa, and forme
also,' upon which Chalinus interposes, ‘no (not for you) ;’ Olympio
retorts, with reference to the nan of Chalinus, ‘ yes, (on the contary,)
for me, 1 say,' and then Chalinus, ‘no, not for you,but for me :’
here, in the same line, we may translate the first eirea by ‘ yes’ and
the second by ‘no,' but there is, in reality, no inconsistency, for in
each case eirea is employed to contradict the preceding speaker.

In the following passage inre conveys dissent from the form in
which the preceding speaker expresses himself, but assent to the
substance of his proposal; Epid. 11. ii. 95, E. Vbr' erit empta, ut
alique ex urbe amovear: ne'si quid tua Serus sententia esf. P. Ima, docte.
