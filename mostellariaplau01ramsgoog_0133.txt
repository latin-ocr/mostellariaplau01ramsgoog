but it is more simple to make mun'qunm leui a Spondeo. The hest

MSS. have et ei instead of leer', but this does not affect the scansion.
Poen. 1. i. 71 (Senon),

Sine dunno magno quae elui neutr'puam potest, ⁴
where mutr'qunm must be a dissyllable. These are the whole oi the

examples in the Delphin index, and the same are given in the index

ol W„ preceded hy the remark “neutiquam prima correpta” I think

I am justified in asserting that neun'quam is unisormly a dissyllable.
Now lor neuter. Merc. ΙΙΙ. i. 40 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),

Neuter strupre' causa caput limaret-Di inmortales!

where neuter is a Spondeo. Neuter is found also ln Cas. V. iv. 3²
and Stich. V. lv. 51, but ln both these passages the text is so
uncertain that nothing can he founded on it. Iu Stich Ι. ii. 84
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Certumne est, neutram normarum persequi inperium patret?
neutram is a Spondee3 so also in Mil. 11. v. 18 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Et tu et tic—Non nos nonniu't-Neutram-Metue maxume,·
Rud. 111. vi. 16 (Sanan),
Vtrum nr's, opta, dum tirell-Neutrum vele:
and Frag. Vidular. ,6 (apparently lamb. Tetr. Anat),
Ego servabo, quasi sequestro detti: neutri reddito dumetum.
ln Aul. II. ii. 56 (Troch Tetr. Cat),
Neutrubi habeam stabit stabulum, si quid deuerti suat,
neuerut' is aTrochee, as also in Men. V. ii. 35 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Vt caveres muter ad me r'retu crem qusrr'enomiz.

In every case, therefore, in ulrich neuter occurs, neuter may be

naturally scanned as a dissyllable and Spondee.
Amator. Weise quotes as examples ¹oi imator with the first long,

Cas. ΙΙΙ. iii. u (Senon), ¹
Hominem unatorem ullum ud forum procedat,

where surely it is quite as good to make the rst loot a Trlbrach as
an Anapaest3 again, Epid ΙΙ. ii. 30 (Trocln Tetr. Cat),

Olorem ornatae occurrebant, s‘n‘s quaeque amutorrlus,

where it is better to leave a hiatus aiter quaeqru than to lengthen im.
(It will be observed that nn] must he pronounced as a monosyllable.)
So in Merc. Ptol. 4 (Senar.),
