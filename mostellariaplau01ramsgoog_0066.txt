ORTHOGRAPHY. xlvii

PROGNATVM [4], SAXSVM [5]‚ PROGENIEM‚,MA10RVM,
LAVDEM, CREATVM, STIRPEM [7]. From the above ex·
amples it would be impossible to deduce any rule or principle by which
writers were guided as to the insertion or omission of the letter.

As to the omission of final s, we have ANTIOCV‚ n.1095,
LECTV, n.1313 bai, PATRONV, n. 1033: and in combination
with est, sulvus, n. 1444, SITVST, n. 1297, VOCITATVST
[13]. A few more examples will be found in the index to Mommsen,
but they are by no means numerous.

M,N.

ln derivatives and compounds m had a tendency to pass into n
before the letters c, q, d, t. Thus we have uniformly before c, Clan-

culum, Numnbi, Sanciput, Premepn but horumce or hornum before
d, Tantundem, Tandem, quandam, Ornanda, Nundinaa Clandestanus,·
before t, Iunndem, tec. Before q, however, there seems to have been
a diversity of practice with regard to the manner of writing the same
words, depending probably upon individual taste: thus in MSS. we
find indifferently umquam, memquam and unquam, nunquam· tamquam,
quamquam and tanquam, quanquam· utrimque, utcumque, quatumque and
utramque, utcunque, mutuaque. On the other band m is almost always

retained in numqua, quanquam, namque, plerumque, utrumque, quemque,
amnemque. As a solitary example of m into n before i, we have
quomam=quom tam.

The passages in the grammarians‚ with regard to m into n, are,
Priscian, p. 555, who, after giving as examples, tandm, ananum,
tunnam, nuncubi, adde, “ et, ut Plinio placet, nunquzi, nunquam :''
Priscian, p. 945, gives eudem, eandem, wmdam, quandam, quorundam,
quarwtdam, all of which however he adds may be written by simple
composition, i. e. by m: Priscian, p. 958, gives as examples of m
passing into n before c, hunc, hanc, harunce, harunce. Compare
Vel Long. p. 22363 Beda, pp. 2337, 23443 Martian. Capell. Lib.
III. p. 55. Marius Victorinus, p. 2462, seems to say that we may
at pleasure unite nonnunquam, nunquam, nunquid, quanquam, ammam,
or substitute m for n.

As an example of the care which it is necessary to exercise in
reading the grammarians, in distinguishing an opinlon from a fact,
we may take the following statement of Cornutus ap. Cassiodorum‚
p. 2285: “Tanatus et Quamuis in medio m babere debent: quam
enim et tam est unde quamnam, mamm, lamias, ΜΘ quosdam moveat
