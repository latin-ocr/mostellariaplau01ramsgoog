148 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

dictum Capitol a capite, quod sacerdotulae in capite etiarn nunc solent
habere,'' Varro L. L. V. ξ 130, ed. Mun. (iv. 29); and so PauL Diae.
p. 57, ed. hlud, “ Capitol linteum quoddam quo in sacrificiis utebantur.’'
a. with sociares understood, Paul. Diae. p. 48, “Capital, facinus quod
capitis poena luitur.” Plautus has it twice ; Men l. i. 16, Numquam
edepol fugiit, tametsi capital ficerat ,· and Merc. IV. iv. 26, C. Eutnchc
capitalsacts. E. Qui? C. Quia aequalem amitalem, abun Ir'derrou,
entius. See also Lucil. ap. Non. s. v. cupitas 1. ι75 (p. 38).

ln the passage now before us, Weise, following the Ed. Prin in

‚ opposition to the best MSS, reads capitulis aedis sacta est, which

he explains, “Capitalis autem hic est, propter crimen in ea commis-
sum quasi interdicta,’' but he adduces no authority for such emeaning
of capitalis. We find indeed in Paul. Diae. p. 66, ed. Mun, “Capitulis
lucus, ubi, siquid violatum est, capot violatoris expiatur,’' but this cao
have oo place here.

57. Ιιι the well known passage in Virgil G. 1. 203, Non ahter

, quam qui, tto, Aulus Gellius (X. 29) and Servius (ad. loc.) agree that

atque is equivalent to stanin, and in the line now before us scholare
propose to translate atque by ‘forthwith' I do not however see that
this is necessary, and would render it simply ‘and then‚' ie. ‘the
next thing that happened was! There are however several passages
in Plautus where the latter of two events connected by atque is repre·
sented as following so immediately upon the former that the conjunc·
tion may fairly be translated ‘forthwith;' thus Bac. II. iii. 45, Dum
cr'rmmspccto, utque ego lembmn conspicua· Epid. II. ii. 33, Ouum ad
pestem uenio, atquc ego ellum illic ardeo praestolante· Mero ΙΙ. iii ι7, ³
Nunc si dt'co, utres est, atque illam milvi me Emissa radim, quemadmodum ἶ
exiitumet mel Atque illum opstrahot, trans mure lim venum asportet ,· ¹
Capt. 111. i. 19, Salvete inquom, Quo ebrus uno, inquom, ad mandant?

utque illi tacent,· to which we may add Merc. 11.iit17, i. 35 ; Trin ³

Ill. ii. 43 3 but scarcely Poen. 111. iii. 38. In Cas. Prol. 48 at seems
to be equivalent to statim and in Amph. 111. ii. 74 utque is most
convenientiy translated by ‘but'

62. Mirum quin vigilanti diceret] ‘It is wonderful that the
man who was murdered sixty years ago did not tell his tale to my
master when wide awake,’ the force being ‘Itis a very likely story, is

it not, that (the ghost of) a man who was murdered sixty years ago
would tell'his tale to one who was wide awake l' mium quor implies
strong irony, and is employed to evince the impatient contempt felt
by the speaker for some statement or observation made or implied
by the person with whom he is conversing. Thus Amph. 11. ii. 118,
