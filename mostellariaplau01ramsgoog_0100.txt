before two consonants which follow in the same word: ist, isse,
&ccum ille, iste, ipse, inde, bade, antur, inm, nenpe, damah and some
others.

In the above and other words oi a similar character many metrical
scholars have maintaIned that there was an. evident violation of the
Rule oi Position, and scanned lines in which those words occur, as
’ 11 the last syllables in apud, amor, dcc, were short, and so also the
first syllables in erse, eccum, &c

But another solution of the difficulty has been proposed, which we
bave no hesitation in adopting, viz, that all the words given above
were occasionally, in familiar conversation, pronounced ‘correpntn,·’
that is, the first syllable was almost entirely suppressed in enunciating
the word, and thus the dissyllables were transformed into mono·
syllables Much may be said in favour of this view.

1. It will be seen that, with very few triliing exceptions, all the
changes made by the Roman poets upon words are in the da'rectrhn
«ff contrectabas

a. lt will be observed that all the words enumerated in class r
are dissyllables, having the first short, and that in the greater number
the short vowel is followed by a liquid, so that there would be little
difficulty in pronouncing them in a syncopated form without de·
stroying the sound ο1 tbe word. Some ο1 these words must be
pronounced ‘correptam' even when position is not involved.

3. Those in class a are all words which recur perpetually
in dialogue‚ and are exactly the kind oi words which would be
abbreviated in conversation.

4. We can lind abundance of analogies in our own language,
some ο1 them completely in point

5. lf we pass to foreign languages we shall find that the same
holds good with respect to them.

6. If we trace the passage ο1 certain of these words into the
Romance language we shall perceive that many of them were
adopted in an abbreviated form, thus affording an indication at
least thatin the popular dialect such abbreviations were common.

Now before proceeding to give and discuss examples of the two
classes of metrical anomalies we have just mentioned, it is necessary
to call attention to the fact that even the epic and lyric writers ο1 the
Augustan age assumed the right of modifying the forrn or pronun·
ciation of certain words which must otherwise have been altogether
excluded from their measures, or which, in their ordinary shape,

would have been productive of embarrassment. These changes have
