a son whose birth had long been eagerly looked for.

18. Here, salue: salvam te advenisse gaudeo: Vsque rnaauu'stii]

23, 25. The words generally employed by the dramatists to
denote the outer door of a dwelhng-house are Ianua, Ostium,
and Foris or Fores. Os these the second occurs more frequently
than the first, and the third more frequently than either of the
two others, the plural Feres being more common than the sin-
gular Ferri, which may be accounted lor by supposing that doors
