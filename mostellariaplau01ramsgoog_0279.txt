accomplished and attractive female slave seems to have varied from
ιο ιο dominae. Thus Stratippocles, Epid. 1. i 50, is represented
as having paid 4ο minae lor a beautiful captive girl ; in the Cure. 1.
i. 63, Phaedromus complains os the leno who was the proprietor of
Planesium, Alias me poem pro r'lla triginta miras Aliizr talem
magnum. He at one time aslis 3ο minae, at another 60, and in IL
iii. 65 she is represented as having been sold sor 3ο, with the addition
of ιο for her apparel and ornaments. In Merc. ΙΙ. ιιι. 93, ιο minae
are spoken οι as a reasonable price lor a handsome female slave, ¹
and 30 minae were pald by Philolaches sor Philematium, and by
Pleusidippus lor Palaestra, Rud. Prol 45. The same price was fixed
ior the attractive Pamphila in the Phormio, 111. iii. ιι. In Pseud
I. i. 51, iii. 110, Phoenicium is represented as having been sold
lor ιο minae; and in Adel. ΙΙ. ι. 37, IV. vii 342 20 minaeis the
price paid by a leno sor a psaltria In Pers. IV. iv. ιι 3, a maiden
believed by the purchaser to be a slave is sold without awananty
for dominae, the seller having at first asked 100: Tuo penaio sex·
aginta haec datur argenti nunti. In Poen. lv. ii. 7 5, two little girls,
one five, the other sour years old, were sold to a dealer bya Sicilian η
pirate ior 18 minae (it seems doubtful whether the nutrix who was
sold along with them was included in the above sum). Phaedria tells
Thais, Eun. 1. ii. 89, that he gave ιο minae sor a little black girl
(ex Aethiopia ancillulam) and an eunuch, both ol which he had pre·
sented to her. As to men, Hegio (Cap. ΙΙ. ii. 103, iii. 4, ιο) values
Philocrates, whom he regards as a young able-bodied slave, at ιο y
minae; andin the same play we are told that a little boy was kid-
napped when four years old and sold ior 6 minae (Cap. V. ii. ιι,
iii. ι, iv. 15). In the As. (Ι. ιιι. 77, ll. ii. 97) Cleaereta agrees to
make over her daughter Philenium to Argyrippus exclusively for one
year (lianc annum) lor ιο minae.
