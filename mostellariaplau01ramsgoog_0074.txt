METRE AND PROSODY. lv

especially is comparativelyrare in the 5th place, although many
examples may be quoted, as Most 1. i. 23, .

parantes opsonate pollucibilem·
and 111. i. 40,

D. Hic nmo est thanai. T n. Hic homo certe ist ariolus·

and in 1. i. 69 we have two Dactyls consecutively in the ath and
5th places. Lines however constantly recur which contain no
Iambus, except in the last place, e. g. Most. 1. i. 4,

Ego pol te ruri si veham ulct‘scar probe,

where we have an Anapaest in ,the rst piace, followed by four
Spondees3 inv. 18,
Augebat ruri numerum genu' ferratile,

we have Spondees in the rat, and, and 5th, and Dactyls in the
3rd and 4th; in v. 16,

Quod fe in ptitrinum scir mmmm tradier,

we have five Spondees in succession.

The penthemimeral caesura is preserved with considerable regu-
larity, although, as might have been expected, it is frequently
neglected.

Πκ Iambs'c Tetrameter Catalectic,

called by the Latin grammarians Septmanics and Comibus Quadrato,
was formed, according to the views of Varro, by the addition of
three syllables to the Iambic Trimeter.*

It consiste of seven and a-half feet, and admits the same feet as the
Trimeter, viz, the Iambus, Tribrach, Spondee, Anapaest, and Dactyli

There is a division of the verse at the end of the 4th foot,
which thus ought to end with avvord, and this rule, although occa·
sionally violated by the Latin writers,'is observed by them more
strictly than by the Greeks.

All the above-named feet are adrnissible in any place of the verse,
but the Spondee and the Anapaest are rarely found in the 4th, and
the Dactyl is still more uncommon. Bentley would exclude both the

* Varro, quoted by Diomedes, p. 514, and by Rufinus, pp. 2796, ²⁷07·

† Bentley and Hermann add to these the Procelcusmatrcus (ne. υυυυ),
but l believe that all the passages quoted in support οἱ thus opinion are
eithegi manifestly corrupt, or may be scanned so as to tet nd of such an
intru er.
