There is no controversy that, in so sar as the text os Plautus and
Terence depends upon MS. authority, there is an immense number
os cases in which elision is altogether neglected‚ that is, in which the
last syllable ol a word ending in a long or in a short vowel, in a
diphthong or in the letter m, is not elided before aword beginning
with a vowel, a diphthong, or the letter Ιι. Weise refers to sixty·six
“indubitata exempla '' in the Amphitruo alone, and every play will
furnish alarge number. But notwithstanding this, not a few oi the
editors ol Plautus, by changing the order ol the words, by inserting
or omitting monosyllables and ejaculations, or, when the rnore simple
means iail, by bad and arbitrary conjecturat changes, have con-
sidered themselves entitled, at any cost, to force the verses of Plautus
into accordance with the metrica] mles observed by poets whose
compositions are of a character totally different, and who flourished
at a period when the language and the laws of versification had
reached their highest point os cultivation and stringency. The first
who undertoolc to satisfy the conditions os this seli-imposed law was
Pylades, os Brescia, who considered the simple explanation, “metri
causa,'' ajustification for any change he thought fit to introduce
into the text, and many of his interpolatione were adopted by his
successore, and long maintained their ground. Others followed in
the same direction until the work of destruction and reconstruction
seems to have been pushed to its extreme limit by Bothe and Ritschl.

Bentley, while admitting that the licence was frequently resorted
to by Terence, endeavoured to establish a code of rules by which
he supposed it to be defined and *limited These were-“In his
autem aliisque similibus tria sunt observanda, numquam hoc fieri
nisi in verbo monosyllabo; quod verbum si in vocalem exit, oportet
syllabam esse longam3 ictum denique habere in prima syllaba
Anapaesti. Harum vero conditionum ignorantia quot nuper peperit
errores? dum et in polysyllabis verbis, et in syllabis brevibus, et in
aliena sede, posse fieri hoc existimabant.''
