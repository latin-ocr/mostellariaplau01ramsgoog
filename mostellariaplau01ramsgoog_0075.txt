lvi PROLEGOMENu

Spondee and the Anapaest hom the 4th place, but Hermann, while
he admits the canon when the division oi the verse is observed,
considam that when the division is not observed‚ the Spondee, the
Anapaest‚ and even the Dactyl are all admissible.

In so far as the mh soot is concerned, the Latius admit ireely
the proper loot, the Tribrach, the Spondee, and the Dactyl‚ the Ana-
paest more rarely, and generally include it in a single word.

Finally‚ this verse iu Asynartete‚ and therefore the last syllable ol
the 4th foot may be either long or short, and the hiatus in this
place is freely permitted.

According to what has been said above, the scheme ol the Iambic
Tetr. eat. will be as follows :-

ture indicated above‚ selecting our examples lrom the Mostellaria,
