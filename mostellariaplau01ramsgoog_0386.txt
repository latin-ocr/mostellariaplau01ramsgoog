EXCVRSVS XIV—TALENT VM, MINA, etc. 243

the Latin dramatists,* and also Talentum magnum argentr,† proved lor
a considerable period a source ol embarrassment to scholars until
Gronovius (De pecun. vet) demonstrated that these terms‚ like the
simple Talentum or Talentum argenti, denoted the ordinary Attic
Talentss and that the epithet magnum was occasionally employed by
the Roman writers, lor by them only is it used, because they first
beca'me acquainted with the word Talentum in their intercourse
with the Greeks of Sicily and ol some cities os Magna Graecia,
who, like theold Italians, had adopted copper as the standard oi
their currency, and whose money Talent was therefore a Talent
oi copper, and equivalent to a very small sunu Hence when the
Romans, at a subsequent period, first became acquainted with the
Attic Talent, they would naturally seek to distinguish it from the
small Sicilian taient by attaching to it the epithet magmm.§

In like manner as Talentum and Talentum argenti are used indit·
lerently, so are Mirm ΙΙ and Argmti numaeil and likewise Draclrmae
and Draclrmae argenti s. argenteae.** When in one passage, T ruc.
V. 8, we read, Ego, mea voluptas, sr’ quid peccavi prius, Subplr'ctlem ad
te lanc menam sero auri, we must understand menam auri to signily
not ‘a pound os gold’ but ‘the value oi a Mina, or pound ol silver,
in gold!

We have said that wherever mention is made os Greek money in
the Latin dramatists we must refer it to the Attic standard. To this
there is one exception, where however the distinction is caretirlly
marked, Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 23, Trapeattae mille draclunmrnm Olnmpr‘eum,
Quas de ratt‘one utimum, redditae. What these Olympio Druchmafl
may have been we cannot tell, for, as sar as 1 arn avare, they are
not named in any other passage in the Classica.

lst will bc seen, by referring to Rud.V. ri 43, 43, 33, V. rii. 19, 24,
that Talentum, ‘lalentum magnamtubarum argenti magnum, designate the
same sum.

§ 1 am aware that this explanation of the meaning of talentum magnum

has been controverted, but 1 believe that it is generall accepted by the
best scholars and numismatologists .The subject has been discussed by
Bentley, with his usual acuteness, in the chapter on Sicilian Money ιιι his
Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris.
