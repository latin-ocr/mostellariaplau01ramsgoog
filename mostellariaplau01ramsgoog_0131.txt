' Ex unoquoque coram excurram &epilam pannariam,

where the word must be scanned polentacium, although pilento has
the first short in Ovid and Persius, But here we may observe that
poleniarcicr is a word apparently coined by Plautus himself, and found
in this passage only, nor is it used by any other author until we
come down to Apuleius, and there is no reason why we should not
connect it with the kindred pollen. In so far as the unsavoury johe
is coucemed, the readers of Rabelais will at once pereeive that it
will lose nothing of its force if we derive the word direetly from
pollen, and not through the medium of ῥοὶεηία. ’

Suspecta, the substantive, with the second long, is frequently quoted
as an example of an anomalous quantity, because suipicca the verb,
has the second short. But suspicio, the noun, occurs frequently in
Plautus and Terence, and has the second syllable uniformly long ;
it has the 'same syllable long in Martial and the later poets; and, as
far as 1 know, no example of this word, with the second short, can
be quoted from any classical writer.

So also Rribrilus (from raideri) occurs twice, Cas. l. v. a, Stich. 1. iii.
773 coquinamm (from coquinas), Aul. ΙΙΙ. i. 3, Pseud. ΙΙΙ. ii. 643 and
coquinare, rr. 85; but these words occur in verse in Plautus only,
and therefore we cannot compare his practice with that of other

poets. Moreover, with regard to the first, the derivation os rcibcilus ¹

from cribro is by no means certain; and with regard to the second,
we might be led to believe, from a passage in Paul. Diae. (p. 61,
ed. Mart), that the form used by Plautus was coquc‘tare, and not

urnarc.
cqurotcrvus and its derivatives have the first syllable short in the

Augustan writers, as in the Horatian Choriambic,
Vra grata pritcruc'las,
and the Ovidian pentameter, ἱ
· . Damnaret nafifacta praterea pater,
while in Plautus Bac. lV. iii. 1 (Troch. Tetr. Aean),
petulans protervo c‘racundo animo, ricdomc'lo, tircogc'lato, ’
{md Amph. 11. a. 207 (noch. retr. ca),
Audacem csse, ct confidenter pro se c! proterve loqui,

protervo and proterve must have the first long. When however we
remember the uncertainty and inconsisteney which prevails iu the best

writers as to the quantity of the first syllable of words compounded
with pro, we need feel no surprise with regard to protervus.
