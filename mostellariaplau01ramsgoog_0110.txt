transposing lui aud omitting maim, which will male all smooth.
Moreover‚ it will be found that much confusion prevails in this por-
tion of the scene, and that various violent changes and transpositions
’ are necessary in order to maintain the system in its integrity. Hence
obviously we may pronounce that there is in reality no authority for
satellites. In Weise's tert we find the reading os the MSS, and he
calls the line a Troch. Tetr. Cat, but how he proposes to scan it
Icannot tell. Ἴ

The word supellex in the nominative occurs in Aul. 11. v. ιγ,
Men. 11. iii. 53, V. ix. 96, Pers. IV. vm a, Poen. V. iii. 27, in all
oi which we may adhere to the quantity of supellex, as found in
virgil, Propertius, Horace, and Juvenal, although some ol the MSS.
and earlier editions, including the Vulgate, uniformly write suppellex.
But two passages, in which the word appears in oblique cases,
presente difficulty. In Poen. V. iii 26 (Senar.) we have-

Tace alqrtc parce mult'ebrt' supellectili ,·
and in Stich. 1. ii. 5 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Iam quidem in suo qualique loco ntit' erit mt'ltt' stium nepellectilzi,

where the Palimpsest and the Vet. con Camer. have quicqum the
cod. Decurt. and the best Vatia, Μαι,- the Cod. Lips, quoque ;
the Ed Princ., quaeque,· the Cod. Lips, sitm the Palimps, the Cod.
Lipa, and the Ed. Princ, supellectilis ,· the two Pali. and the Vat,
suppellectilis. Moreover, Festus (p. 294) and other grammarians
recognise supellectile as a form of the nominative.

This being premised‚ il' the two lines as given above exhibit the
genuine tert, then the word supellectili must undergo some modi-
fication. According to the views oi R. it will belong to the same
category as that in which he has placed expapillalo and satillites,
and may be scanned as supellectili& aless violent mode of escaping
from the difficulty would be to sink the second syllable and to pro-
nounce supleclilai. But neither expedient is necessary. As to the
first example (Poen. V. iii. 26), we may avoid all embarrassment '
by a simple transposition—

‚Tace atque mulcebri parce supellectili,·

in the second (Stich. I. ii. 5), the rhythm os which is so harsh that
R. proposes to rewrite the line, we may, without violence to the MSS,
consider mpclleclilis as a nominative, and write-

Iam quidem in suo quaeque loco mii erit milti tila supelkcaln,

the corruptipn having in all probability originated in some early
