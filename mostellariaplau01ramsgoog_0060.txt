TERRA3 in Β, POSIDET, but also ANNOS; in 6, ANNOS; in
’1, ACCVMVLAVI‚ but the two Cs may here he regarded as
belonging to separate words. ln 10 (the S.C. de Bacchanalibus)
the rule is most strictly adhered to; there is no example of a con·
sonant doubled, and between thirty and lorty words written with
single consonants where double consonante would have been used

at a later period, e. g. BACANALIBVS, HABVISE, ESENT, ·

NECESVS, ADIESE, IOVSISET‚ FECISE, CONPROMESISE,
CONIOVRASE, COMVOVISE, &a

The sarm holds good os the Polla inscription (ΒΕ. 132), but the
examples are less numerous: MILIARIOS, TABELARIOS, MEI-
LIA bis, SVMA‚ REDIDEI. In 11, probably a few years later

12 the preponderance is very decidedly in favour os the doubled

consonant: ATINGAT bis, NECESITVDINE‚ IVSEI ERVNT,
