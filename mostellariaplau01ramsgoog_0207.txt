The following scene appears under avery mutilated form in the MSS.
ln order to elicit any sense, a lew additions and changes must be made
upon conjecture, but these are, with one or two exceptions, not very
serious. Hermann, Ritchl, and some other modern editors, following the
ignis fatuus of metrical systems, have made alterations which are altogether

in several instances the corruptions affect all alike. The words within
brackets are supplements introduced by various scholars to supply the
blanks which occur in the MSS.

The names of persons prefixed to this scene in B are-Temo,
Tnsvaorrnns sunu, Dnursrn.
