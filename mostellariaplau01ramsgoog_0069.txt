111.-THE METRES AND PROSODY OF PLAUTUS.

Contr'c Melus*

There is no topic connected with classical literature which,
generally speaking, proves so repulsive to a young scholar as an
inquiry into the metres of Plautus and Terence. This arises not
ao much from the difficulties which the subject presente, although
these are unquestionably numerous and perplexing, as from the
manner in which the subject hasbeen handled. He will find him·

self called upon to peruse a series oi disquisitions by different

authors who accord with each other neither' m principles nor details,
but, on the contrary, exhibit for the most part fierce autrigonum,

agreeing in this only, that each propounds his ideas with dogmatic
confidente, and assumes a contemptuous and insolent tone towards
those whose views differ from his own.

The extreme positions in the controversy are held by two
parties. The followers of the one, whenever they encounter a
difficulty, are satisfied with calling it a ‘licence'-a term which,
il used sreely and without discrimination, suffices to abrogate all
metrical laws.

Those who adhere to the other have persuaded themselves that
the verses of Plautus and Terence were constructed with the same
delicate care, precision, and stricmess which characterise those os

the best Greek models, and that wherever we meet with any com· Ι

bination inconsistent with this doctrine we must at once pronounce
the passage corrupt, and proceed to correct it Π we adopt this
view to its full extent, we shall be called upon to re-write at least
one-fourth os the plays now extant. .

The ample space between these two poles has been occupied by
those who entertain more moderate opinions, and who by their
researches have done much to throw light upon what is obscure.
But almost every one oi these has some favourite hypothesis ap·
plicable to a particular class oi cases3 these hypotheses are for the
most part founded on a very limited and imperfect induction, and

* Thro ughout this cha ter itis taken for granted that the reader rs
familiar with Latin p yand versification, as exhibited' ιιι the works os

the Latin poets from Lucretius and Catullus d.ownwards
