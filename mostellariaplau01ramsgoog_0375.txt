These words convey the idea ol ‘excesu' But it must be borne

in mind that excess naay be os two kinds. The word mey denote ι

that the object spoken of transcends the limita os what is right,
proper, or convenient, ln which case censure is conveyed, or it may
denote that the object spoken of transcende the limits by which such
an object is usually bounded, and in this case censure or praise, or
neither, may be conveyed, according to circumstances. The tormer
meaning is usually expressed in English by the word ‘too,' the latter

by ‘excessively,' ‘most' ‘very’ and is equivalent to a superlative l
Thus when we say that a person or thing is too long, or too short, ¹

too rich, or too poor, we wish to indicate that the proper limit, in
each ease, has been passed; but when we say that a person or thing
is excessrbely torg, or excesnbely short, excessrbely rich, or excesnbdy
poor, we do not necessarily imply anything except that the usual or
ordinary limlt has been passed. ln Latin Ihiinn, Ilb‘rnr'ru, are used
in both nenses, and we must, in each case, be guided by the oon·
text iu determining which ol the two is applicable. The same takes
place in our own lunguage with ‘too,’ bnt to avery small extent, in
such colloquial phrases as that ir begnod, too detrghtful, too charmrhg,
too rtilt‘culour, too absunt. The following examples will illustrate
what we have said.
