The ancient Romans employed the aspirate more sparingly than
their descendants. They did not employ it before a vowel at the
beginning of many words in which it was afterwards generally
adopted, and they excluded it altogether from those syllables in
which it was afterwards placed after a consonant. Thus Quintil 1.0.
Ι. ν. 7, “Parcissime ea veteres usi sunt etiam in vocalibus, quum
ordor, ircosque dicebant Diu deinde servatum ne consonantibus
aspiraretur, ut in Graccri et trzicmpri. Erupit brevi tempore numius
usus, ut choronae, cremantes, praechones, adhuc quibusdam iuscrip
tionibus maneant: quade re Catulli nobile epigramma est.'’ And
Cicer0, Orat. XLVIII. i 160, confirms the statement of Quintilian,
“Quin ego ipse, quum scirem ita maiores locutos esse ut nusquam
nisi in vocali aspiratione uterentur, loquebar sic ut puteos, Cetegos,
treicmpos, Kartaginem, dicerem,” &c

Although the use of the aspirate became more common in the age
of Cicero and of Augustus, it was again dropped to a considerable
extent in the decline of the languagc: thus Marius Victorinus (fourth
or fifth century), p. 2466, when speaking of the use of lr in certain
words, “Sed credo vos antiquitatem sequi, sed quum asperitas vetus
illa paulatim ad elegantioris vitae sermonisque est limam perpolita,
sic vos quoque has voces sine H secundum consuetudinem nostri
seculi scribite;” where, when speaking of anh'qur'tas and uetus illa
aperias, he must be understood to refer to the Augustam age.
Hence, in amatter of this sort, the testimony of MSS. is absolutely
