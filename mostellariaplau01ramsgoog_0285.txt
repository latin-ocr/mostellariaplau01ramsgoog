142 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

page will supply examples. The only passage in any classical writer
in which intro does not imply motion is in Cato R. R. 57 5 7, who,
when descanting on the virtues of pickled cabbage, declares, Et ,η’
be'le‘s· atro est, et si lfems turgent, et si cor dolet, et si secur, outprelmoner,
aut prooodi‘a, uno verbo omm'a sano foo'et intro quae dole'tobunt,
although he had said in the previous sentence, Si quid anteo moli
intres m't. Forcellini quotes a passage from Palladius I. 40, eet ri
pelam munis, sistro stare non posset, where, however, the difficulty is
removed by a slight change in the punctuation, which ought to be,
sipe'lom mr‘seres intro, stare non possit.

48. eventione] So the MSS. Nonius (p. 509) quotes a line from
the Hecuba of Ennius in which he employs evenat for eveneizt, and
hence Both. and R would here read evenant but the introduction

l

of this form here is altogether unmlled for. cf. Curc. 1. 'n 395 ζ
Epio. ll. ii. 105, ΙΙΙ. i.2; Trin. 1. ii.3; insome of which the change 2

may be made with propriety. See also peruemnt,Rud.III.ii.1s;
Trin. 1. ii. 56.

54. mute're] ‘to speah even in awhisper! Mutz'o or mettio signifies
properly ‘to speak through compressed lips,' and hence ‘to speak
in a whisper,' and sometimes ‘to mutter' or ‘ grumble,’ as in Amph.
1.t225, M. Etehm mutel? S. Iam tacebo. Occasionally it is used
humourously with regard to inanimale objects, as in CurnL i. ao,
of a door (osteum), Belle‘ssumum hercle uidi et taciturnt'ssumom, Neon·
puom ullum uerbum mutet: quom curetur, tacet,· and again u. 93, Vide!
eet spernentur aedesfestebeltsumae! Non mute't cordo: so also neu us'rgoe

Pers. V. ii. 465 Andr. III. ii. 25. In one passage in Terence, Her„

V. iv. 26, mutin must signify ‘to be silent τ’ P. Dic me'lie', hamne rerum
num quid osea· aiem patri? B. Nihil. P. Neque opus est: Adeo mutato:
placet non fieri loc e‘te'detn, ut in comoediis Omnia omnes ube· meamne.-

&c., where adeo mutto must mean ‘be silent then' or ‘remain silent’* η

We have also a substantive munh'o in Amph. 1. iii. 21, a line which
we have quoted above in the note on Ι. i. 33. The frequentative
form musso is found in Aul. II. i. 12, Neque occultum e'd hoben' neque

* Freund tales this quite differently3 he seems to suppose that munito
ls the ablative of the participle, and would construe neque opio est adeo
mutilo, ‘there is no need of whispering it about 3' but if that were the
construction it would rather mean, ‘there is no need of speaking about it
in a whisper,’ i. e. ‘you may speak openly if you please,' which is directly
the reverse of the obvious sense of the passage.
