Nam me Acheruntem renhere Orcus nolur't,·
Mil. 111. i 3² (Troch Tetr. Cat),
Quid ais tu? r'tane me· ego vt'deor oppilio Acherunticus?
Trin. 11. iv. 93 (Senam),
Cemetur censu ad Acheruntem mmtuor.

See also Amph IV. ii. 9, V. i 29, Capt 111. v. 31, V. iv. 1, a,
Cas. 11. viii 12, Bac lI. ii. 21, Mero. ΙΙ. ii. 19, 111. iv. ar, Trim 11.

We have said that the first syllable is generally long in Plautus
lor two or three examples are quoted in which it is said to be short.
Butos these there is only one which will not bear examinatior.
This is Most 11. ii. 76,

Virmn me accurunt ad Acheruntem mortui,

where all the best MSS. have the cd, which however might very
readily have been interpolated by a transcribet, and be omitted
without injury to the construction, and it is singular that the poet

· should have made the first syllable oi Acheruntem long in u. 67
and short in v. 76. Three other examples are quoted from the
Ponrulus-Prol. 71 (Senam), L ii. 131 (Troch Tetr. Cat), IV. ii. 9
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

r. Ipse abiit ad Acheruntem ct'rte remim.
a. Quo die Orcus ah Acherunte mortuos anteierit.
3. Quodvis genus ihi homimem uidem, quari Acheruntem venerii.

But in the first example, an Anapaest in tireseeond place of the
Senariau is perleetly admissible3* in the second, we may consider
the and foot to be aDactyl; in the third, quast} as elsewhere, may
he pronounced as a monosyllable and totally elided. And yet the
evidence afforded ol the quantity ol Acheruns in these three lines
is considered hy Weise sufficient to prove that the whole play is
spuriousl The evidence therefore lor Acheruns in Plautus rests on
the line oi the Mostellaria alone, which, as we have pointed out

above, is suspicions and easily corrected.

ι * [ls an Anapaest admunhle in the second place after a Dactyli Would
rt not be sim ler to omit the ad, as suggested in reference to the e
quoted lrom ost. ll. ii. 76? Spengel would read abit formitu- m]
