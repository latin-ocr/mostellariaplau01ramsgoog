11. Manum adire alicui, ‘to disappoint,' ‘to frustrate,' ‘to belool,’
‘to deceive,' ‘to play a trick upon! This phrase was probably
suggested by the play among children ol stretching out a hand con-
taining some object as il to present it to a person, and then, when
the victim ol the jolre is about ιο take the object, suddenly with·
drawing the hand: thus Aul. ΙΙ. viii. 8, Ita tiles ruputas omnr'bro adii
manure, (Ι disappointed all those filthy lellows—lrustrated their
designs ;' Cas V. ii. 54, Quid nunc? satra lepide adila esi vobit manus?
‘haven’t you been cleverly jockeyedl' Poen. ΙΙ. ιι, Εο pacto avarae
Veneri pulcre adii manum,· and a. 16, Qum scibuul, Veneri ιιι adrem
leno martum Pers. V. ii. 18, Vt me in tricas com'ecrih‘! Quomodo de
Persa manus mc‘lri adita est! In the last-quoted example we have
conicere in trr’cas, ‘to entangle in a net ;' and so lV. i. 9, Nunc ego
lenonem iia hodie ciciricalunr dabo, Vr ipsus sese qua se expediar nesciat.
(See note on Most. ΙΙΙ. i. 45 (4ι).)

12. Circum. Verba compounded with circum frequently imply·
that a person is ‘led round,' that is, not straight to, but away lrom,
an object which he wishes to reach‚ or, that one person ‘gets round’
another, that is, takes him at disadvantage by coming upon him from
behind. Such verbs are frequently used iu the general sense ol ‘to
deceive,’ (ιο cheat:' thus circumducere, construed with the acen-1
sative ol the person cheated, to which is generally added the ablative
ol the thing out ol which he is cheated: thus As. 1. i. 83, Qua nec, qua
uxorem, qua tu servom Sauream Potes, circumduce, arescr,¹ Truc IV.
iv. ιι, Τ rrduom hoc saltem, dum aliquo mr'les cr'rcumduciium Pseud. 11.

Poen. V. v. 7 circumducere and langere are combined: Sic dedero.-
aerc uuhlari augere lenunculum; Nactus est hamum, mrito quem
argenti circumduceret: other examples oi circumducere in Pseud 1. v.
16, Trin IV. ii.17. There is a carious anacoluthon with rr'rcuut-
ducanr in Pseud. 1. v. 115, but perhaps the passage is corrupt
