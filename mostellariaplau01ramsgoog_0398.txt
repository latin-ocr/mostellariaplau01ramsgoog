according to 'the natural soree ol the words, would lead usttotnler

that the slaves'weresometimes hung up by the leet, head downwards.
But it seems doubtful whether this is really the meaning ol the
phrase: thus Aa. II. ii. 33, La Quot pondo led esse cosses medum?
Lr. Noa edepol scio. Es. Scibam ego te nescita· atpol ego, qui ted
expendi, sab: Nudus vehem emam. pondo er, qumodo pendes per pedes.
Lr. Quo argumento z'sloc? La. Ego daiam quo argumento et quo modo.
Aa pedes quando adligatus es, aequum ceniupoerdriem, Vos· manus montiae
complexae sun! atque adauae ad trabem, Nec dependis, nec propendi,
quin malm nequamque seh* Although the interpretation of some
portions ol the above lines is by no means certain, it is quite evident
that when Leonidas says penus per pedes he means ‘suspended by
the hands with the feet hanging down weighted,' and hence when we
find in Cas. 11. vi. 38, 0. Mihi ut sortzh'o mensal. C. Vs malon
hercle pedr'bus pendeas, the signification is probably the same.

Sometimes goede (stimuli), that is, long poles with sharp iron
spilres, used sor driving cattle, were employed to prick the flesh,
under the pretext that the ahin os habitual malefactore had beoosm
so indurated as to be insensible to the lash: Pseud 1. ii. 4, Neque ego
bomem magei ascitos umquam urdr', ita plagii costae calknl, Quos dum

· L. Qui latera cossuram tua quae obcalluere, pago· Cas. H. viii. 10, ΑΙ

candidatus cedei lic masaga, Sieinulorum loerch, ‘whose body.is a

The goad might be, applied to one hanging up: Men. V. v. 48, A!
ego le pendentem fodiam stemulis trigoria dien· or to one bearing about
-thesurea or patibulum (see below) ; Most. 1. i. 52, 0 carnuficium
‹crebriore-quod credo sore, Ita te forabunt pahbuhtuor per uras Stimulos,
si leuc emensa! [quam prinum] senex.

ln the lines last quoted reference is made¹ to aiorm of tortum to
which we find numerous allusions. Aheavy log of wood was em·
ployed‚ forked at the extremity (furca), or with across piece like
a gibber patibulum„ the hands of the slave· were attached to the
'limbs ol the log, which he dragged about, and was flogged or goaded
as he staggered painfully under the load: Pers. V. .ii. 72,¹ Τ. Satis
