xlviii PROLEGOMENA.

si m non sonat: iam enim supra docui non sonare debere tametsi iu
scriptura us posita sit.'' Cf. Caeseli ap. Cassiodor. p. 2314, and
Isidos. Origg. 1,,26 post med But although it is here said that we
ought to write tamnu and quominus, we have no reason to believe
that these words ever were written under that form, and therefore
we must regard this as merely a theoretical speculation as to what
ought to have been, not what actually was.

N is occasionally omitted, in old inscriptions, in the middle of
aword, but not apparently upon any fixed principle: thus in 2,
COSOL, cssoR, COSENTIONT, hut we have CONSOL‚ CEN-
SOR, in another part of the same inscription, and also in1; in 10,
COSOLORETVR thrice, but also CONSOLVERVNT, COVEN·
TIONID. The abbreviations Cos. and Coss. for Consule, Consulibus,
seem to have originated in the use of Cosol for Consul.

There 211212 great diversity of opinion upon this point among an-

cient gramman'ans Priscian, pp. 551, 564, 854, 897, 898, 931, writes
hm, dempsi ‘misti promptu} sumpsi and demptus, comptus, promptus,
sumplus, mni ademptus, redemptus, and also emptus. Terent 822111,
pp. 2256, 2261, admits that it was common to write sumptu, demptus,

'· comptus, but calls p in this case “superuacua'' and argues that the

introduction of it is 1112116221 At the same time he tells us that there
was 2 dispute whether hiem or hemps was the correct orthography,
and decides in favour of the former. Papiriam ap. cassiodor, p. 2292,
rejects hiemps, but says that sumpsi, sumplus, sumptum, must be
written with ap. Beda, pp 2337, 2346, rejects isimps, but adopts
sumpse sumpturus. Mar Victorin, p. 2466, insists upon wridng
heims, sunuel, insumet, denual, and utterly rejects such forms as
consumptum, emplum, temptat, attemptat.

Thus we see that while Priscian, Terentianus Scaurus, Papirianus,
and Beda agree in writing morpss‘, sumptus, dempto, demptio, conspui
’ comptus, emptus, and the lilre, Marius Victorinus rejects thep in each
case. All seem to agree iu preferring hiem to ln‘emps.lt

Setting aside itinn, inscriptions insert the p in the above words
and their derivatives more frequently than they omit it. But 2 good
many examples of both 222111.
