viii PREFACE.

believe to have been prevalent at the time when Plautus wrote,

and which we may therefore presume to have been actually
employed by him From the manner in which these con-
clusions are stated, it would seem that the author had intended
to adopt such modes of spelling in his text, and I attempted
accordingly to carry that idea into effect.

But I soon found that the attempt involved inconsistencies.
The number of cases as to which the inscriptions referred to
can be regarded as affording any clear evidence is extremely
small; and however strongly wemay be satisfied that in such
cases Plautus probably did make use of some particular mode
of spelling, in the vast majority of cases we have no evidence
from inscriptions at all, and we are obliged to fall back upon
that afforded by the best MSS. Now, although it is doubtless
true that in the case of Plautus the authority of MSS. is of
less value on points of orthography than in the case of later
writers, inasmuch as during the two succeeding centuries little
interest was felt in orthographical and grammatical questions,
while a respect for the antique as such was almost entirely
wanting; still, since the evidence of inscriptions is so meagre,
and fails to afford materials for a complete orthography, I have
thought it more consistent and uniform to adopt an orthography
based wholly upon the best MS. evidence, than one based partly
on the inscriptions of one age and partly on the MSS. of
another-an orthography which, as the author remarks in the
Prolegomena, might preserve a flavour of the antique, but
which could not be regarded as representing the practice of
any particular author or of any particular time. And it is
obvious that if there is no distinct object to be gained by the
adoption of a peculiar mode of spelling, it is undesirable to
deface a text with forms which shock the eye of all but the
scientific scholar, and throw a needless difficulty in the way of
the young student.

Ι have refrained therefore from adopting in the text those
modes of spelling for which we have no sufficient MS. authority,
