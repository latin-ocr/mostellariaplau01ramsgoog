132 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Pseud. l. i. 99. Observe that in Mil. ΙΙ. νί. 35, paradare heum sig·
nifies ‘to complain of you‚' ‘to accuse you ;' and so postulateb, Cas.
111. ii. ab. See also Bac. 111. iii. 38, 45.

104. Perpennam] ‘Rouge.' It was made by boiling fine challr
with the purple dye obtained from the murex. Plin. H. N. XXXV.
d, j 26, E reliques caloribus quas a damehe's dari daretur propter mag-
nr'tudeieene preti ante amnes est purpurissum. Creta argentaria cnm
purpuris pariter hisgue'teer bibitque eum calorem celereies lanei. Cf.
XXXV. 6, j 12. The form purpuream is quoted by Non. p. 218,
from the Sanniones of Naevius, Inle'na cretam, emersam, perpennam.
Plautus uses also the participial adjective purpurissatas, Truc. lI. l.
35, Quia adea sores nostras urguentis uncta es ausa accedere, Queaqae
istas buccas tam belle purpereisalas habes.

105. Interpolare] This verb Is found only ln the form of a
compound‚ but we can scarcely doubt that the simple pola is derived
from the same root as palr'a. The true meaning of the word seems
to be ‘to renovate,' ‘to furbish up,' ‘to change the appearance of an
object‚' the idea being usually implied that this is effected by the
addition of something which enters into combination with‘the original
object It is said to ha've been properly a term describing the
operations performed by fullones in cleaning woollen garments, and
this explanation is supported by a passage in Cic. Epp. ad Q. F. lL
xii. a, when speaking of Antiochus of Commagene3 Quod vult, eie-
quam, renovare honores easdem, quamam {agam praetextam quotanus
eieterpalet, decernendum nihil censeo, i. e. ‘to save him from frubishing
up his old toga praetexta ever year.'* Vestimenta aieleepda in the
Digest XVIII. 1, j 45 are opposed to nava. Cf. XXI. i. 37.
Hence it signifies “to clean’ slmply, without the notion of adding
anythIng, as in Ptin. H. N. XII. 14, j 32, Ae, Hercules, Alexandreae,
ubi tura e'rderpolantur. The meaning of the expression in Aul. IV.
iao is very doubtful. Of the word used ln the general or figurative
sense of ‘to invest an object with a new aspect‚' we have a good
example ln Amph. I. i. 160, where Mercury‚ addressing his orm
clenched fist, observes, Alia farma oportet esse, quem tu pugno legera,-
to which Sosia rejoins, Illic hama me interpolabat, mumque as finget
anua· and tn cre. in verr. Aes. 11. i. 61, s 158, Hoc moa aa seu· a ¹
saluti suae praepetere dedr'cit, referenda e'n tabulas et prr'valas et publicas κ

* lt is well known that rogae were cleaned and whitened by rubeng in
chalk or pipe·clay; hence the phrases (Livy lV. ²5) album in aestimentiam .

addere perionis . . . causa, and (Pers. V. 177) cretata ambitio. Compare
Plln. H.N. XXXV. 17 § 57.
