248 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Although rl'maus must mean a Delirachm in the passage quoted
above from the Truculentus, there are two others in which com·
mentators have believed that it clearly denotes a different sum, and
these we must examine. ,

In Heaut. Ill. iii. 38 Syrus fabricates a story to the following l
effect: that an old woman of Corinth had borrowed 1000 drachmae ’
(drachmarum argenti mille) from Bacchis, and, having died without
paying her debt, that her young daughter Antiphila had been left as
security in the hands of Bacchis, Ea relicta aare arraboni pra illa
argenta. Everything is distinct up to v. 43, but unfortunately the
text 0f the two lines which follow (44, 45), as they appear in the
older editions, is admitted by all to be corrupt, and has been variously
emended by different editors. ln these lines the words mille marm
are found, and the sense is taken to be that Bacchis now wishes
Clinias to pay her 1000 numi, in consideration of which she will give
up Antiphila. It is taken for granted that the maile numum are
identical with the drachmarum argenti mr'lle previously mentioned,
and hence it is inferred that nunrus is here used as equivalent to
drachma. Now although it might be fairly urged that a passage in ,
which the text is avowedly corrupt and the meaning uncertain cannot
be received in evidence at all, yet, even admitting the interpretation
to be generally correct, it by no means follows that the conclusion
is inevitable. Syrna, to answer his own enda, had just characterised
Bacchis as apersuma metria, and what is more likely than that he
should represent such a person as not satisfied with having the mere
principal of the sum which she bad lent repaid, but as secking a large
addition for interest, and as taking advantage 01 the passion of Clinias
to demand double the original loan, that is, according to the view
given above, 1000 Numi 012000 Brachmae. Terence uses numus ¹
in one other passage only, Phor. 1. i. 3, 4, where the phrase intro-
duced, pauxilulum nanterum, decides nothing.

The second passage is in Most. Il. i. 10, Vel isti qai [haeai] trriarrr
narrarunt causa subeunt salsulae, where Lipsius and others interpret
tres numito mean tres asses, and to refer to the daily pay 0f a Roman
soldier. It is urged that this explanation is corroborated by the ¹
well-known passage in Polybius (Vl. 37), where he informs us that
the Roman legionary received two obols a day, which, if we adopt the
common practice of the Greek and Roman writers, and reckon the
drachma and the denarias as equivalent, would amount to 3} asses. But
there are various considerations which render this opinion untenahle.
