top to bottom,' the sall being unintermpted, no portion being leit
standing. Perpetuus properly conveys ¹the idea os unbroken eon·
tinuity; it is seldom, il ever, equivalent to the English perpetual, in the
sense ot' ‘lasting sorever,' but the meaning may generallybe expressed
by ‘unintermpted' Thus perpetue elego, applied by Pliny (H. N. 111.
v. 7) to the course oi the Apennines srom the Alps to the extremity
of Italy, denotas that the ridge was continuous or unintermpted;
perpetuas mensae (Virg. AEn. vll. 176) are long tables stretching in a
straight line up and down, unintermpted or unbroken by a transverse
pieee bke the triclinum,- perpetuae quaesn‘ones were the courts sor the
trial os certain criminal offences, which sat from year to year ‘without
interruption,’ unlike the special commissions appointed from time to
time. Perpetuus and the adverb perpetuo are often employed by
Plautus and Terence, uniformly with the force above explained.

that this connection between our families should remain unbroken;’
and the same phrase recurs IV. iv. 14. The sentiment expressed
by Auxilium ln Cist 1. iii. 46, Vt sunt humanu, nihil est perpetuom

compare Hec. 111. iii. 46. The expression perpetuus modies is peculiar
