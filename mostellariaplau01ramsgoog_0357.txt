antecedent to qui is cistellam acm crepunah (a. 4 3), or simply cistellam

Qacic occurs perpetualiy in the dramatic writers, and modifies the
clauses with which it is combined in so many different ways that it
demands close attention. We may perhaps class the different mean·
ings under three heads. Of these, two are simple and distinct, but
the third is somewhat complicated.

r. Quia is employed in direct interrogations, in which case it is

i. e. al c's nan. η

explanation of some statement or remark made previously, either by
the speaker himself or by the person with whom he is conversing.
It must be borne in mind that a speaker may repeat the remark of
another in different words, for the purpose of ascertaining that he
has correctly understood the remark in question, secking an ex·
planation, aa it were3 or he may repeat a remark previously made
by himself, for the purpose of making his meaning more clear, thus
giving an explanation, and all this may be done without emotion,
or with an expression of anger or of impatience, and the emotion may,
in many cases be indicated by the tone of the speaker, and hence not
