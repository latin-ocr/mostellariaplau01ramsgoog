MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. ix

Some plays, amongst which is the Mostellaria, have been very
careiully corrected, and by different hands, iu others the corrections
are few and insignificant, in others wanting altogether.

Such then being the state of the MS. as awhole, it will be evidently
necessary to describe the portion of the MS. which applies to each
play separately, as the remarks which apply to one portion will
obviously not necessarily hold good of another.

The Mostellaria is written upon twelve sheets, os which ten are
complete, eight lines at the beginning os the first being occupied with
the conclusion oi the Bacchides, and twenty-five at the close os the
twelfth being devoted to the commencement oi the Mouchmus. Each
complete page contains, as a rule, fifty-two lines, but two or three
bave only fifty-one, one or two fihythree. We have first os all the
tros, mori> pnsum MUsTELLARIA,inredcapita1s; then we
have the acrostic argument in eleven lines, which reads Mostellaria,
and then without a break

At the topos each lest-hand page we have Plauti, at the top of
each right-hand. page Mostellaria, each in a large cursive hand. At

the conclusion, ,

all in red capitals.

The play seeum to be written from beginning to end in the same
hand, though it is impossible to assert this positively, as in several
places the siae of the hand is suddenly enlarged (eg. 1. ii. 22-29,
111. ii. 69-73), the original sire being resumed after a lew lines,
while the last leaf, especially where it joins the Meneclmus, is written
in inlr ol a darker shade, and very probably by a different hand, from
the rest. The changes in the size of hand may possibly have arisen
hom blanlrs having been left when the MS. was first transcribed,

,which were subsequently filled up from other sources

These are‘by many different hands.

r. Corrections evidently made by the tirst hand on casua] slipS,
the colour os the inlr being the same as that os the original writing.

a. Corrections made over an erasure, where the colour ol the inlr
having ,been changed by the roughened suriaco, it is extremely

difficolt to determine whether they proceeded lrom the fustor horn
