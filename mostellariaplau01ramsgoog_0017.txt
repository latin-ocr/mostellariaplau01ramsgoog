way to the more recent. Such being the case, it is obviously
not worth while to disfigure a text for the sake of what is
only a greater probability on one side, the evidence shews
that Plautus probably wrote es in nominatives and accusatives
plural, eir in datives and ablatives, more often thanis: but it
isstill more probable that he employed both forms, and in a
case like this, where the MSS. actually do preserve traces of
variety, it is better to follow that variety implicitly, whenever
we have confidence in the MS. reading, than to adopt a rigid
uniformity which we can assert with something approaching to
confidence was not observed by our author. I have therefore
endeavoured in all such cases to reproduce the best MS.
reading3 the critical notes will almost always indicate the
authority followed.

Next, as regards that part of the Prolegomena which deals
with the metres and prosody of Plautus. The MS. of this
portion of the work was in much confusion, had evidently
undergone little or no revision, and had apparently been
written at different times. The examples had not been finally
selected or arranged, the connection was often imperfectly
traced, and some lines of argument will be found to be hinted
at rather than followed out. The greater part seems to have

been written not very recently, and without any reference to the
labours of those more recent German critics who have been

waging so fierce a battle as to the true principles of Plautine
prosody, amongst whom I may mention Fleckeisen, Corssen,
Studemund, Spengel, Ritschl (so far as concerns his later views,
which present some important modifications from those ex-
pressed in his earlier writings), and in our own country
Dr. W. Wagner, who in the Prolegomena to his valuable
edition of the Aulularia has laid before English readers a clear
and powerfirl statement of the view of Plautine prosody opposed
to that adopted by Mr. Ramsay and by the bulk of English
scholars. And this is the more to be regrettedâ€š as Mr. Ramsay
had devoted much attention to the subject of Latin prosody,
