EXCVRSVS xv-SLA VE PUNISHMENTS. 251

Before quitting this subject we may advert to the circumstance
that a great deal oi bad money was in circulation, and hence, when

Ἴ a sum was paid, not only was it, customary to assure the receives

that the coin was good, but it was submitted to some slrilled person,
in order that it might be scrutinired and tested ς thus Pers 111. iii. 3²,
Num· sexcenti iric erunt Probi nunuratr', sec sit meir, liberamque
huc connitur adduce. D. Iam saxo dic erit, Non, hercle, cui mm doc
dem spectandam, scen· and again, lv„ vi. 1, Probae· hic argenti surr!
’ sexaginta nahae.

That sorgeries were common we might infer from the number ol
counterieits‚ many of them executed with great ingenuity, which are
preserved in the cabinets ol collectore There are the numi plumbei
oi Plautus5 thus Cas. 11. iii. 40, Cur' domiin leodii peculi nunus non.
est plumbea, ‘a sellow whose savings do not amount to a bad
shilling3' so also Most [V. ii ra (i. 33), Tace ris, freber, qui cudere
soler plmbeos Numos,· and Trin. IV. i'u 120, erite aurum crederem, Cui,
ri caprit's res n'et, smmum numquam aedan plumbeum? ‘is it likely that
1 would trust that lellow with gold, whom, were his all at stake, l
would never trust with a bad shillingi’

xv-PUNJSHMENTS INFLICTED UPON SL'A VES.

Since the triclrs and deceptione which so often lorm the staple
of the New Comedy are ior the most part contrived and executed
by cunning slaves, and since their own masters are not seldom
represented as the victims ol these irauds, it is not surprising that ·
the works oi the dramatists shordd abound in words and phrases
applied as taunts to those who had paid the penalty ol previous
offences. The expressions employed are curiously varied, by Plautus
especially, and a multitude ol terme seem to have been coined ior

lhe'l'lljrteffldg{dimou punishment for an ordinary offense was the scourge

(flagrum) applied to the naked back (dorsis s. dorsum-tergm s. ter·
gam) and shoulders (scapulae), osten with such severity as to produce
livid marks, scars, and wheals (niatrtics-offerrumentne), and even to
ilay off the suin The instrument employed was a cat made of
ropes (restes), or strips oi ox-hide (argrinum-lora), or bundles ol
rods (vr'rgae) in which elm twigs (vr'rgoe ulmeae) generally took the

place ol our own national hirch. k Ι
