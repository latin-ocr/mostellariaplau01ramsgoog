...sometimes τ’ so Eun. IV. iv. 47, moda ait, moda negat, ‘at one
moment he says “yes,'' and the next moment he says “nol'' In
the poets and later writers various adverbs are substituted lor the
second neoda, such as nunc, aliquanda, anundum, ac statam, saepe, nan-
umquam, rursus, tec, but these constructions are hardly to be found
in the dramatic writers.

Every one has felt that in animated conversation or eager discussion
the thoughts ol a speaker not unfrequently outstrip the powers ol
utterance, and hence single words or even whole clauses are sup·
pressed‚ and must be supplied by the hearer.

The same thing happens in vehement declamation, sometimes
unintentionally and sometimes designedly on the part ol the orator,
and, generally, such an omission may naturally take place whenever
a speaker is, or rushes to appear to be, under the influence ol great
eagemess or strong passion. The words which indicate achasm oi

this kind, in the dramatic writers, are lor the most part nam and ·

enam, which serve to introduce an explanation ol some difficulty
suggested by what goes before, although the connecting link must
osten be mentally supplied.

appear in person on the stage, and take partin the action os the play.
He then informs them that the scene is laid in Thebes, proceeds to
give an account oi Amphitruo and Alcumena, and tells us how the
former had some time previously gone forth in command oi the Theban
army to war against the Teleboans: Is (sc. Arnphr'trua) prrusquam
hanc abrit ipsemet in exercitum, Gravidam Alcumenam uxaransecit suam.
Nam ego uos novate medo ram ut sit pater maa, Quam liber harum rarum
multarum aret, Quantasque amator quom quid complacatum est jamnel: Is
amare accepit Alcumenam clam uarum-where themam is introduced
most abruptly‚ and we must supply the train ol thought somewhat
alter this lashion: ‘having mentioned the beautiful Alcumena, you
will no longer leel any surprise that Jupiter should be mixed up with
this business, for, I doubt not, you are all by this time well aware ol
what sort oi person my father is: &c.; Truc. lV. iv. 3, Baua et lutea
