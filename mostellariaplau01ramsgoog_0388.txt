were known as Gold Philips, they were up to a recent period to be
iound in circulation on the eastern borders of Europe, they are still
>frequently discovered in large hoards, and numerous specimens are
to be seen in all collectione ol ancient Greek medals* They are
mentioned frequently in Plautus,† and must have been a common
medium when the authors of the New C'omedy flourished.

We may enumerate the different names by which they are designated.

ln the Poenulus we find three hundred spoken of as, Ι. i. 37, aurei
trecenti numi Philippei,· IIL iv. 3, aurei trecenti numi qui vocantur
Philippei: iii. 57, treemtos numos Phlippe- l. iii 6, trecentos Phi·
lippos. In the Bacchides we find two hundred spoken ol, IV. viii
41, ducentos numos aureos Philippos prohos; ii. 7, dueentm Philippos
aureos,· cl. ix. 45, 87, 103, ducenos numos Philippos· viii. 27, ducenti
Philippi,· cs. o. 38, ix. 127, and simply o. 10, ducenti numi,· cf. IV.
iv. 55, 58, viii. 32· In the Trinumus‚ a thousand, V. ii. 34, mr'llr
ouri Philippum· o. 15, mille numum aureum· cs. IV. ii. rra, where
the reading is doubtful ς see also As. 1. iii. r, Trin. 1. ii. ¹¹5·

When Agorastocles says, Poen. Ι. ii. rga, Sunt mihi entus nesceh
quot numi auree'lumphetice', he means ‘gold Philips struggling to make
their escape,' as il they were madmen under restraint

There is a puzaling passage in Rud. V. ii. 26: Labrax is describing
the contenis ol the Vidulus; we read in the Vulgate Text, Nunti
octingenti aurei in nrarsupio ensuerunt, Praetereo eentum denarie Phi·
lppeo in pasceolo seorsus, but the word donario is altogether destitute
ol support from any good MS. The Vetus Codex ol Camerarius
gives, Pretereu centum neno philipphi, which may mean ‘a hundred
Minae in Philips: ii we suppose that there was a familiar idiom by
which the singular could be substituted sor the plurales when we
talk ol ‘a hundred pound’

lt would appear that Philips, in consequence ol the ease with
which they could be procured, and the purity ol the metal, were
commonly employed as bullion by artificers who executed works in
gold; hence the allusion in Cure. lll. 70, ibi nunc statuam volt dare,
auream Solidem sarriendum ex auro Philippeo.

*They passed into Gaul and irom thence to Britain, and the whole ot
the early gold coinage os these countries “may be said to consistet imi·
tations more or less rude and degenerate ol the Macedonian Phihppus”
See the admirable work ot Me. John Evans on the Coins ol the Ancient
Britons. Lond. 1864, p. ²4· Ι

† Never in Terence, who adhered more closely than Plautus to hrs‘
ffiek originale. The name oi Philip may not have been agreeable to an

t enian audience.
