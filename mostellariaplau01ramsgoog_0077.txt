lviii PROLEGOMENA.

According to what we have said above, the scheme of the Troch.
Tetr. Cat will be as follows :-

υ υ -υ -υ -υ -υ -υ ῦ
uem υυυ υυυ υυυ υυυ uem υυυ
υ vu υυ -υυ -uu -υυ
υ υυ vu· υυ- uu-

Bacclnbc Verres.

It is doubthrl whether Bacchiae Verses were ever employed by the
Greeks, for the few examples quoted are all susceptible of a different
mode of scansion. They are common in the fragments of the Latin
dramatists, and specimens arc to be found in most of the plays of
Plautus.

The species which occurs most frequently is the Bacchiae Tetra-
meter Acatalectic, which is found sometimes in asystem, sometimes
combined with other species, and sometimes interspersed among
verses belonging to other classes, especially Cretics. Bacchiae
Tetrameters Catalectic‚ Trimeters licat„ and Cat, and also Dimeters,
are met with occasionally, but they are comparatively rare.

The proper foot is, as the name implies, the Bacchius (υ - -), and
the following is a pure Tetrameter :— '

Sili purique ruri mea't si male emptae.

The Molossus (- - -) is used freely, and is admissible in every
place, frequently in the rst and grd, less frequently in the and
and 4th.¹
