168 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

ee'us caput Iove' sacrum esset: same'lea ad aedem Cereris, Liberi, Liber·
aequaverunt iret, on which Livy remarks, Hac lege euris uurpreus
negant quemquam sacrosanctum erse, sedeunt qui eorum cuiquam necrurs'f
sacrum sanciri. See also Law of XII. Tables quoted by Secund
Virg. AEn. Vl. 609, arrd Hor. S. 11. iii. 181, is eulestabilir et sacer esu.
Τὴε theory seems to have been that any man who was solemnly made
over and devoted to aGod was thereby placed beyond the pale of
human sympathy and protection. It is commonly asserted that an
individua} under these circumstances was sacer dis rustris, but ln both
quotations given above where a God is named it is Iupiter. See
Macrob. S. Ill. 7. Sacer in the general sense of ‘worthless,' ‘good-
for·nothing,' ‘vile,' was originally, as might be expected, applied to
persons only, and this is the case uniformly in Plautus and the earliest
writers (Bac. IV. vi. 14, Poen. Prol. 90, Rud. I. ii. 69), but Camllus
applies the epithet to a book, XIV. ra, Dr· rugus, hombe'lene et sacrum
labellum, and to a ranlc smell, LXXI. 1, Se' quoi, Virro, banc sacer
alarum obsunt bran, while the auri sacra santes of Virgil (AEn III.
57) has passed into a proverb. With regard to the use of uuus in
the line before us we have an exact parallel iu Truc. II. i. 39, Sed est
leue'c unus seruos urbleutissumus.

45. e‘s vel Herculi conterere quaestum possuit] The wealth of
Hercules was proverbial among the Romans. 1. He was regarded
as the guardian of hidden treasures, and those who discovered
such hoards were wont to ascribe their good fortune to the favour
of the G0d; thus Hor. S. ll. vi. 10, 0 sr' urnam argeun'fhrs quae
mebi momlret, ut illi Thesauro euvento que' mercenarius agrum Illum
psum mercatus aravit, debes anesio Hercule; and Pers. S. ll. 10, 0
se‘ Sub rastro crepet argenti mebi serra, dextro Hercule. Indeed it
would appear that, according to popular belief, Hercules was looked
upon in the same light as those spirits who in Eastern and Northern
mythology are supposed to dwell beneath the earth, brooding over
and watching hidden gold; thus Acron explains the allusion in
Horace, Ideo quia thesauris praeest, et sunt qui eundern Iucuboueru¹ esse
belehi, to which we may add the following curione notice in the tract

known to writers on Roman topography as Curzbsum Vrbis Reman*
Among the remarkable objects in the Regio XIV, the Transtiberina,

⁴¹ The title at full length as it appears in the Vatican MS. is-Ineipir
Curiosum urbis Romae Regionum XIIII cum Brebiariis suis. lt will be found
in Muratori, Thes. inscrip. T. lV., and is given at the end of the first
volume of Becker-'s Haudbuch der Riimischen Altherthiimer. See also
Bunsen, Beschreibung der S. R. Tom. l. p. 175. It probably belongs to
the early part of the fourth century.
