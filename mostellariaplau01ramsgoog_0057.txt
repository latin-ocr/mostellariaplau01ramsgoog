xxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

1111111111 in 14 we have also PECVNIAE once. So we have
OQVOLTOD in 10, PEQVS lis, PEQVDES‚ but also PECVDES.
PERSEQVTIO‚ 0QVPkTAM, all in 14; PEQVLATN) in 10,
and the blunder PEQVLATVV twice in 16. Το these we may
add QVR, 111454, Qvun, 111006, QVRAVERVNT, n. 1418,
PEQVARIORV, 11. 1130.

It has been proposed to write the adjective reliquas, where it occurs
in Plautus, as reli‘cuon because it is in many 01101 aquadrisyllable;
but this idea receives no support from inscriptions, in which we lind
RELIQVEI [20], RELIQVIAE, 11. 1009,1016‚ RELLIQVIAE.
n. 1051, and different parts 01 the verb relinquo, qbeing uniform in
all cases.

Thelettcr X.

X, the 1111 101101 in the Latin alphabet, was, according to isidorus ⁵
[Ι. 4) and Petrus Diaconus (p. 1582), not introduced until the age
01 Augustus. But thisis an absolute mistake‚ for we find SAXSVM
[5], ADVEIXI [9], EXDEICENDVM, EXDEICATIS, EX·
STRAD [10]. Much confusion however appears to have existed
with regard to the exact power 01 x, and hence we find a great
many examples 01 PROXSVMVS, MAXSVMVS, VIXSI, DEIXSI,
VXSOR, ALEXSANDER, and the like3 and so SAXSVM and
EXSTRAD in the examples quoted above.

The question as to the orthography 01 Exsrlzicm or Exrlrirm
depende 01 course on considerations altogether different.

V.

V did not properly belong to tlre Latin alphabet, but was intro-
duced at a comparatively late period to represent t in words
transplanted directly 110111 the Greek. We cannot fix with precision
the period when it was first employed in writing, but there is
scarcely a single trustworthy example 01 11 10 110 found in inscrip-
tions anterior to the death 01 Caesar, but the i· in Greek proper
names, and the like, is represented generally by u, and more rarely
by ι’, as in Anticus, ERVCINA or HERVCINA‚ GLVCERA,
LVCIOS, ILLVRICVM, PVLADES, SIBVLLA, SVRVS, 110,
cursim, HIMINIS, SISlPVS. The name HYPOLITVS‚
n. 741, Momms, belongs to an inscription certainly not older than
B.C. 11.

There is no reason to believe that such a character was known in
the age 01 Plautus, and therefore we may salely eject it wherever it
