lxii PROLEGOMENA.

ι Priscian (p. 1326) takes a totally different view oi these verses;
‘⁴ Terentius trochaico mixto vel confuso cum iambico utitur iu
sermone personarum, quibus maxime imperitior hic convenit, quem
puto ut imitetur hanc confusionem rhythmorum facere. Sunt autern
trimetri ac plus minusque, et habent penultimam versus syllabam in
quibusdam longam, et iu quibusdam breve, ut in Andria’' He then
quotes the first iour lines quoted above, and then goes on, “Haec

Α number ol Bacchiacs occur in Act l. ii. r seqq, and these we
shall give according to the arrangement of Hermann, noting the
changes which he has introduced into the text, which arc neither
numerous nor Mportant. It is to be understood that the whole oi
these lines are Tetrameters Aeatalectic, except such as are specially
noted as belonging to a different species-

v. r. Molossus in and place.

equally well ii we pronounce diu as a monosyllable, and make a
