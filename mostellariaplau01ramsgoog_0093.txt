predecessors had endeavoured to escape from the difficulty bysol·
lowing one οι two paths-

ι Either by correcting every passage in which they discovered
a violation os their own metrical canons, and ιιι this way-to nse
bis own vigorous words-‘⁶ singulos sere versus miseris modis, ad·
dendo, mutilando, invertendo, contra Codicum iidem, iugulant et
trucidant'' -a description which applies very closely, not only to
the persons indicated by Bentley, but ιο many modern editors,
conspicuously to Bothe and Ritschl.

a. Or else they lay down the broad principle that wherever a word
occurs in Plautus and Terence, ιιι which the quantity differs from
that exhibited by the same word m the epic and lyric writers, it must
be held that the dramatists merely represented the ordinary pro·
nunciation οι these words at the time when they wrote. Ιι this doctrine
be accepted ιιι ιιι full extent, it will supersede the necessity sor all
further mquiry, and we may freely make long syllables short, and
short syllables long, and at pleasure extend or curtail the natural
dimensions of words. Bentley, while rejecting this hypothesis as
untcnable and even ridiculous, urges that ιι ιι were true we should
lind at all events uniformity ol practice with regard to the same
words, while, on the contrary, it is notorious that the dramatists
sometimes observe the ordinary prosody, and sometimes deviate
from it, in the same word. Thus Ille, Esse, Propter, have the first
syllable invariably long' m the later poets; in Plautus and Terence
they are apparently sometimes long and sometimes short.

Bentley then proceeds to propound his own views. He admits

’ that these departures from the ordinary rule must be regardedas

alicence—“ Licentia certe erat3 et indigna sorte, cui Romuli nepotes
indulgerent '—but absence restricted within well· defined and nar·

row limits: -

1 Τιιιι vowels naturally long are never shortcned, but those only
which being naturally short become long by their position before two
consonants. According to this view, although matris from ιιιᾶιιν
could never have the first syllable short, ιιιιιιι Ιιιιιιιι from ιιιιιι ιΙίι might
have the second short. This rule may be true, but the number οι

examples rs too limited ιο enable us to speak positively.
ι. The number oi words which adrnit of such licences rs small,

There is much truth in this observation‚ but the statement is¹ not

sufficiently qualified. It will be seen, from the instances given,
