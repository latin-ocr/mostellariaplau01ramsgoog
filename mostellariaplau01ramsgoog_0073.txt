What we propoae at present is to examine-

l. Those kinds ol verse employed by the dramatists, with regard
to the existence and general structure ol witich no reasonable doubts
can be entertained

11. The prosody ol Plautus and Terence, in sofar as it is really
or apparently at variance with that with which we are familiar in the
worlrs ol the Latin poeta from Lucretius downwards.

lt may be urged that this is not the natural and logical arrange·
ment of the subject-that a knowledge of the prosody ought to
precede an inquiry into the versification. But in practice the plan
we have indicated will prove the more convenient. We can find
numerous examples which will enable those acquainted with the
prosody ol the Augrrstan age to comprehend the structure ol the
different verses of which we treat; and when we have acquired a
general knowledge of these, we shall be enabled to discuss those
particular cases in which the scansion is apparently difficult or
anomaloua

is the principle vehicle for the dialogue of Latin comedy, when it is·
carried on in a calm, unimpassioned tone. Priscian, in his treatise
De metrii Commii, asserta that the Iambus, the Tribrach‚ the Spon-
dee, the Anapaest, and the Dactyl‚ are employed “indifferenter''

’ in all the places of the Comic lambic Trimeter except the last,
which is reserved for the Iambus exclusively‚ and this statement is
sully home out by the works of Plautus and Terence. lt must not
however be supposed that such lines as

Time tu patulae rembanr sub tegam piri,
castaneasque nuces mea quos Amantia laboti,
Huic coniux Sychem erat <hitherium ‹lgri

could be recognised, although not directly incompatihle with the
above mle, any more than that

Κατάβα, κατάβα, κατάβα, torrida, καταβήσομαι,
could be accepted as a lair specimen of an Aristophanis Trimeter.
The Latin poets always contrive to preserve the Iarnhic rhythm, and
although Anapaests and Dactyls are not excluded lrom any one ol the

first live places, they arc used more sparingly than Spondees, and not
strung together in an unhrolren series in the same line. The Dactyl
