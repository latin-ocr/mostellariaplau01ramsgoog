excvnsvs xvii-ranas aracusa, a. 285

Aoo, Ecastor quin subrepturum pallam promriit tibi: but it will be
seen, on referring to the passage, that the last line might proceed
quite as naturally from Philenium aa from Argyrippus.

A third example is given from Cas. V. iv. 13, where the words
fiiner ecastor are assigned to Olympio; but it is not worth while
to discuss this, for the whole of the concluding portion of the play
is so mutilated that no reliance can be placed on the text, and a large

‚blank commences in this very line.

Again, in order to prove that women sometimes swear by Her-
cules, we are referred to Mero. IV. iii. aa, where the words Capro
hercle sa're are given to Dorippa3 and to Truc. V. 29, where Phro-
nesium is made to erclaim, Hercle aero serra

ln the former passage, Ritschl, following Bothe, slightly alters the
arrangement of the lines, and attaches Cupio hercle sa're to the
previous speech of Lysimachus3 Quid autem urbani deliqrarunt? dic
mr'ln', Cupio herde sare. D. Sic tu mr temptas sarrs: which, upon
studying the passage, will be found to be a much better arrangement

In the latter there is no reason to prevent us from considering
that the words in question are an indignant exclamation proceeding

from Stratophanes, and nothing can be more probable‚ a priori, than .

that some confusion should arise in the distribution of the dialogue
from the circumstance that the first four letters in the names Strabax
and Stratophanes are identical.

It is very possible that some other apparent exceptions may be
found, but we have little doubt that they may be disposed of as
easily as the foregoing.
