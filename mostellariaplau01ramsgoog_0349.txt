11. Enim. Em'rn ismore common under such circumstances, and
this use ol the word has, in very many cases, been overlooked by
commentators, who, in such examples as those which follow, assert
that entia is equivalent to enrht aero, assuming that arria vera is equi·
valent to the simple vero, and may signily merely ‘truly’ or ‘indeed'
being little better than an expletive. But we maintain thatin the
earlier writers enrht aera always signifies ‘ior in truth‚‘ as enzlst always
signifies ‘lor,' and that both are uniformly employed to introduce an
explanation Frequently the blank is very easily supplied, an affirma·
tion or negation only being suppressed: thus Pers. IL v. 16, S. Qua
datvs bini hic suni in crumena. T. Emitte sodes, ne au'ces fame, sr'rre
ire pastura S. Enim metuo a! possein r'n labilem rer'cere ne vagentur,
‘nay, not so, lor I am afraid that I shall nothe able to drive them
haclr again to their stall, and that they will stray;' Most 111. iii. ²3

boram dedi! Ta. Ego mla cavi recte, ‘n0, you have not, sor 1 have
been well on my guard?

Sometimes the suppressed clause is less simple, but, in general, it
may be very easily deduced from the context: thus Epid. V. ἰ 41,
S. Accipe argentam hoc, Danista: ht'c sunt quadragena martae, Siquid
erit dubim tremulabo. D. Benesecr’sti: benevale. S. Nunc emsa lu
mea cs: here, in all probability, the enz'rn is explanatory ol an action
or gesture-Stratippocles having paid the money proceeds to lay
hold ol the slave whom he had purchased, and upon her shrinlring
back he exclaims, ‘I have a right to take possession ol you, lor you
are now my property ;’ Bac. IV. iv. 51, M. Nunc quid aas adjacere?
