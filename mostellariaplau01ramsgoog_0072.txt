and aTrochaic Dipodia Weiss distributes the seventeen lines into
twentyone, differing toto caelo from both H. and R. Thus, alto·
gether, Weise distributes the lorty·two lines, as they stand in B,·
into fifty-eight, in the course of which he supposes the measure to
change thirty times. Moreover, he is obliged to imagine all sorts
os strange combinations; thus two of the lines are described as
consisting of Dipod. Crescunt Chorrumboe two more as Cretic. numm.

rhythm whatever could be detected by the nicest ear in such a hete-
rogenous combination, where no attempt is made to discover a
system of Strophes and Antistrophes, as ina Greek Chorus. Indeed
it must be evident that any page in a prose author might, without
violence, be cut up into fragments ol varying length, each os which
might receive a metrical title. ’ .

The same Weise boasis that he has discovered and arranged
upwards ol seventy ‘Saturnian Verses' in Plautus, and has ex-
pounded his doctrine fully in a short treatise. But some scholare
bave as yet been unable to settle what Saturnian verse really
was, since these so·called Saturnian verses, detected by Weise,
differ widely from each other in structure, without being connected
by any common bond; and since they are, according to his own
admission‚ altogether distinct from the verses described as Saturnian
by Terentianus Maurus and other ancient grammarians, we leel our-
selves relieved from the necessity of investigating his arguments*

The truth is, however unwilling scholars may be to admit their
own ignorance‚ that the metrical arrangement ol many ol the Cantica
is altogether obscure, and they may be regarded as aliording
exercises t'or the ingenuity of those who love to speculate on such
subjects. Regarded merely as problems os doubtful solution, they
would not be without their use3 but unfortunately many persons
become so wedded to their sancies, and persuade themselves so
lirmly of the reality ol the visionary children ol their imaginati0n‚
that they become not only violent and abusive towards those who
venture to express doubts, but scruple not recklessly to mutilate the

text ol the poet.

* See the ‘Chapter on Saturnian Verses’ appended to the author’s
‘Manual ol Latin Prosody,' Griffin and Co„ 1859, ¹11 which the whole
subject is caresully and critically discussed.
