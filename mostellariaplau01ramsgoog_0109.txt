xc PROLEGOMENA. ’

where it is to be observed that elision is neglected in the division of
the verse after leena Nonius, p. 103, refers to this very line: “ Ex·
pnpsllelo brachio, quasi usque ad papillam renudato. Plautus Milite
glorioso: id, connexum s'n numm levo, expapillolo hacbh,·” and the
expression expapillatis brachio is acknowledged by Paul. Dine„ p. 79:
“Expapellato brachio, exserto: quod quum frt, papilla nudatur.''
But on the other hand expapt'llalo appears in not one of the best
MSS, all of which seem to have had exfafillato bracle, and this in
one of the interpolated family appears as expellito brocheis. More·
over, Paul. Diae, p. 83, has, “Effnfilalum, exsertum, quod scilicet
omnes exserto brachio sint exyilats‘, id est, extra vestimentum filo
contextum.''

Now while we are free to repudiate the etymological explanation,
we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that· there existed a phrase,
effafilalo drncls'o, which was equivalent to exserto brachiis, and it seems
highly probable that the word ffafilato, having become obsolete at
an early period, was explained by grammarians by the more obviously
intelligible expaps'lletn and thus the latter found its way into the text
lt would be contrary to the natural and usual process to suppose
that cxpape'llato, with regard to the force of which there would be no
doubt, would be changed into the forgotten ffafilnlo. The conjecture
of Ο. Mltller, that scylla in old Latin was equivalent to fibula, is very
plausible; reading therefore,

Icl connexum in lumem laeuo effafilolo brechia

we can scan the line without difficulty, supposiug the quantity of the
verb to he either sffslo or fissile· the meaning will clearly be, ‘The
arm being thrust out beyond <or below) the buckle!

Agnin, vdth the word satellites. This word is found in Mill. 78,

with its proper quantity,
Age eamus ergo-Septentrio, satellites,

but R. is disposed to allow the second vowel to remain short before
the double ll, and pronounce sotelleles, relying ou Trin. IV. i. 14,
one of a series of Trochaic Tetrameters Acatalectic. He prines—

Drslraxrssenl deique tulissent satellites lui meierum finde,

whereas all the MSS. have-
Deslraxeisenl disque lnlr'ssenl satellites lns' nse meierum foede,

and me seems to be required by the idiom of the language. Under
this shape the line is impracticable, and hence Hermann reads-

Drilraxs'ssenl deique tulissent lui satellites me joede,
