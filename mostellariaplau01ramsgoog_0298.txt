⁸ NOTES. IILi 43—81.' 155

'- semper lie esf resque a moniaci vesperum Quasi flagitator aetolusque ad
· t} ostrum and for flagitium, Epid. Ill. iv. 77, F. Fida non reddis?

P. Neque fides, neque adeas. Propera egelursugere leisc, si te Di omont.

F. Adsero. Flugvtrb cum murore post reddes tamen. The same practice
‹. ‚ is alluded to in 1. ii. 15, where a debtor erclaims, Qurir edepol egomet
cheron ἄφιξιν, fferam· and Cure. V. iii. 5, Postquam nr'le’l fit,

¹: clamon lorum perca· and in a more general sense Truc. IV. ii. 46,

Iane hercle ego ele, illecebra, dedossoce'rene clamore in veie Quae advorsum
legere accepe'sti a plurimis perunum.

62. te extentorum] ‘to exhaust yourself with bawling,' ie. ‘to
stretch your lungs till they crach! The verb extento, a frequentative
from extendo, occurs again in Bac. IV. ii. r, Quid atur? quae istaec esf
pulsarem Quae te malo crux agelat? ad ritum qu· modum Alr'eno or’res
treas exterus asub? and in Lucr. III. 489, where he is describing a
man seized with a fit, Concidit et spumas agel, e'ergerm't ef tremit orfeu,
Desrsprl, extentat nerum, torquetur, andelam but it is not found in any‘
other Latin author till we corne down to Ammianus Marcellinus.

63. Ne γρν quedem] χρυ, as will be seen from the various readings,
is a conjecture of Acidalius. The MSS. have nec ere’f quedem, which
is quite unintelligible. There are several passages in Plautus where
Greek words are brought in, and these, as might be expected, appear
in most cases in a very conupt form in the MSS. Below, in IV. iii.
46, Μὰ τόν Ἀπόλλω is written correctly in Latin characters in the
Palimpsest3 in Bac. V. ii. 43, Hermann has probably hit the truth
when he substitutos Nat γάρ sor the necor of the Palatine MSS,
which appears in interpolated MSS. and the Vulgate asuerus: so in
Trin. ΙΙ. iv. ιι we cannot doubt that oeclefe or oe clete of the MSS.
has been correctly interpreted by οἴχεται, and that in Poen. I. i.9
lyraelr'm stands sor λῆροι lipom so in Cas. IIL vi. 9, 10, the reading
πράγματά μοι παρέχεις, μέγα κακὸν, ἰι Ζεῦ, rests upon satisfactory traces ;
in Tmo. V. 36 φλυαρεῖν may be accepted, but in Pseud. ΙΙ, iv. aa the
χάριν τούτῳ ποιῶ of Scaliger, the χάριν οἰωνὸν ποιῶ of Camerarius, the
χοῖρε, οἰωνὸν ποιῶ os Lambinus, and the χαίρειν Χαρῖνον volo of Acida-
lius, although all ingenious, are mere guesses, for the characters in
the MSS. are so obscure that they cannot be deciphered with any
approach to certainty.

81. Ne thonalr‘are quid nos porro postules] The word reconciliare
is found three or four times in Plautus, but is not found in the extant
writings of any other classica} author. Looking to the etymology,
since concrlrbye signifies ‘to join together,' ‘to bring into close
union,' and hence ‘to act the part of a go-between or broker' in
