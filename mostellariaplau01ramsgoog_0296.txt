NOTES. III. i. 41. 153

passages: Cure. V. it 15, Quod argenium, quus tu me'lei tricus narrari
Pers. V. 1117, Quid or's, crux, stimulorum tritor) quomodo me hodie
vorscvistil Vi me in trtius-corruenti! In Rud. V. ii. 36, Tricas! means
‘pshaw,’ ‘nonsense’ ‘mere trash3' Pers IV. 111. 61, m‘hil ruhi opus
est Litibus neque irriti, ie. ‘quibbles' Cicero uses the word in
the sense 01 ‘embarrassments,' ‘hindrances :' domesticas lrr'ecs, ad Att
X 8, sub. fin. See also Caelius in ad. Fam. VIII. 5. The original
and proper meaning of tricae seems to have been ‘tlrreeds,' and from
the passage quoted above srom Pers. V. ii. 17 compared with IV. i. 9,
11 10 clear that it denoted ‘a noose' or ‘snare 3' hence the transition
10 easy to ‘a trick' or ‘deception,‘ and hence, as in Pers. IV. iii. 61,
11 means ‘paltry legal tricks' or ‘quibbles,’ and hence in Rud. V.
ii. 36 the exclamation uetus! is 011001 contempt-‘what you offer
is a paltry subterfuge ;‘ and it may be observed that the expression
01 contempt used by Gripus in the next clause is iromus putridus.
Lericographers have sought a different origin and explanation 01 the
word, referring to PIIny H. N. 111. ii. § 16, where he is discnssing
the geography 01 Apulia. He mentions Arpi as having been founded
by Diomedes and named Argos Hippium, which was subsequently
corrupted into ArgyrIppa, and then goes on, Diomedes ibi deleur'tgeutes
Monadorum Dardorumque ei urbes duas quae in proverbi ludicrum
omme, Apr'rrom et Tricam. The proverb itself Is to be found in
Martial XIV. 1. Ι311110, when about to write a series 01 distiches
descriptive 01 the small gifts interchcnged by all classes at the
Saturnalia, says, Sum opimae tricaeque ei siquid orbius 11111, ‘they are,
I admit, trash and trumpery3' and again, 1. cxiv. 1, Quaecumque luri
iuuenci ei puer quondam Apiumque nostras, quas nec ipse ihm novi, &c
Now although the Romans may have been unable to explain the
origin 01 the proverbial expression Apimae Tricaeque, and although
we may find it difficult to give any account of Apc'rrae, no sober-
minded philologist will be willing to accept and rest satisfied with
the story 01 PIIny about the two towns destroyed by Diomedes.
Non. Marcellus p. 8, seems to consider-that tricae is the same
word as the Greek τρίχες, “ Tricce sunt lmpedImenta et implicationes
dictae quasi tericae quod pullos gallinaceos involvant et impediant
capilli pedibus iranIeati.'' Tricoonir in the sense 01 ‘a shuffling knave’
or ‘cheat’ is quoted twice by Nonius (s. v. Tricores, p. 22) from Lu·
cilius, Lucili Cotta senex, Crassi perer leuiei Panaeti Magnus frico suit
nummoriri soluere nulli, Lectum· and again (s. v. Iic‘cae, p. 338), Nec
milri amamre hoc opii nec iricone vadato: and the word reappears

ageio in the Augustan Historians (Capitolia, Ver. 4.) in the sense
X
