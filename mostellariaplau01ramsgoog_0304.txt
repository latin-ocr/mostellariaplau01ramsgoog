NOTES. lll. i. 147-ii. 141. 161

satisfaction’* ln the Vulgate text ol Men. V. vii. 49 we find
redhibebo, but there the true reading is probably reddibo sor reddam.
See Non. s. v. reddido, pp. 476 and 508. The word is generally used
. in referenoe to the purchase and sale ol slaues, as may be seen by
consulting the authorities referred to above, and from Cic. de Off.
111. 23, In mancipio omdmcdo dicendane ochis, non ea, quae uisi dixeris,
redhibeatur mancipium iure cearli, sed hacc, mendacem esse, aleatorem,
furacem, clrehsum.

141. pultiphagus opifex. . . barbarus] ie. ‘no clumsy porridge-
eating Roman workman! Plautus, when translating or adapting his
Greek originale, osten loves to assume the position ol an Athenian
writer, and to raise a langh by designating himself and his country-
men as barbari: ol this we have several examples, e. g. Aa Prol. 11,
huri nomen Graece Onager sedulae, Demophilus scripsd, Morcus vorh't
larbam and again, Trin. Prol. 18, Huic nomeu Graece cst thouara
fabulae, Philemo sompni, Plautus vortit barbare. In Capt 111. 131,
barbarica lege is probably ‘Roman law;' in the same play, IV. 11. 101,
Ergasilus swears by Cora, Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, and Alatrium,
upon which Hegio asks, Quid tu per barbaricos urbes iurare³ in Mil.
11. ii. 56, poetae barbaro is Naevius; in Poen. ΙΙΙ. ii. 21, and in a
fragment ol the Faeneratria quoted by Festus sv. Vapula Papiria,
p. 371011. Mhll, barbarea is Italy3 in Stich 1. iii. 49, mores barbaros
are Roman custosne. On the other hand, barbarum hospitem, Rud. ΙΙ.
vii. 25, is simply ‘a foreign guest 3’ and there is nothing in the
phrase or the context which would justiiy us in asserting that
barbarico ritu in Cas. 111. vi. 19 refers especially to Roman customs.
ln Cure. 1. ii. 63, ludii is Ludii, ie. Lydians, who were not properly
Greeks and therefore are termed Ludii barbari. In Bac. 1. ii. 13,
Nimeiem quam, OLude, es barbaries Quam ego sapere nimio censui plus
quom Yhalemd, stultim es barbaro Potitio: borbarus is used in the
general sense ol ‘illiterata' and then barbaro Potitio siguifies ‘that
ignorant savage, the Roman Potitius! The epithet pultiphagus ι
(pultffagus) which is an dr. λεγ. ties down the barbarus to aRoman
worlunan, iorpuls or porridge made ol sar was the ancient national
' dish among the Roman peasants, as polenta was among the rustic
Greeks. See Vah Max. 11. 5, l 5, and Plin. H. N. XVIII. 8, who,

* ln Forcellini and Freund this is explained to mean, ί111, the seller, said
that he would take her back ;’ but this is contrary to the established use of
the word, and is quite annecessary, indeed it is inadmisslble, for Demea
replico, nihil istoc opus est litigare ego nola von-whereas, it the selles· had

agreed to take her back, there was no room for litigatiou.
