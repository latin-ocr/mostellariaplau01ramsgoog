112 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA

i. 6. ‘all kinds‘ol' hsh;' and from Turpilius, ri flabat Aquilo aut
Auster inoptatum erotpz'scatr', i. e. ‘there was 6 scarcity 61 fish' We
may remark that we use the word firhrhg in adouble sense in
English, when we say ‘he is gone a·fishing,' and ‘he has laada
good fishing.' meaning ‘a good haul ol fish3’ but we cannot with
any accuracy employ the word fishng to denote the fislr captured

66. operere] The verse requires that the penultimate should here
be short, and hence the verb is 666666, but in 111. ii. 656 (650),
optuere srom optarem· and in III. ii. 154, optum'm aad so again in
Amph. 111. ii. ¹93 aprum in Bac. IV. iv. 18, but the text and scansion
ol the line are doubtful3 optaretur, Mil. IV. vi. 56. The simple tuor
is in the received text ol Trin, 111. it 86, Etiam 6666166666 16666
te tumr? multam 66666166, where tueris is an anapaest; and in Lucret-
IV. 449, 066666 quoe turinur fieri tum 6666 166666, and again IV. 366.
So centul is lound below III. ii. 656 (656), and in As, 1. ἰ. 666,
111. i. 6ο, contum, As. 11. iii. 63, Pers. ΙΙ. ii. 66, setun, Most IIL
ii. 656 (649), 6666666, Rud II. iv. 68, rirtuetur, Capt 111. iv, 65,
Truc. 11. vii. 4ο, intuentur, Bac. V. ii. 66, rirtueri, Truc. 1. ii. 58,
mens, Eun· III. v. 36, rirtur'tur, Heaut. 11. iv. 63. Festus, although
his tent is here imperfect, seems distinctly to recognise the double
form, tuor and tueor, and says that when he wrote they were used
indifferently3 but we find nothing in the old writers to support his
notion that tuor originally was equivalent to 66666 and tueor to defendo.
See Fest. and Paul. Diae. pp. 354, 355, ed Muti.

67. G. Pol tibi rituc credo nemen actutum sore. T. Dum staca
sic sit, r'rtrrc “actutum'' 6666] So 1. iv, 24 (65), Philolaches says,
Iam revertam· to which Philematium replies‚ Diu ert “ rhm'' r'd nolti,

76. Nc tu erres, hercle, ,6666661666 nuli non sanes 6666666] So
6666666, 111. ii. 46, Imo 6616 author not, and anh'dhac, Amph 11. ,
11. 79, Cist l.i 1. ¹

73. Satin aeret] Satria is frequently employed by Plautus, not
merely as a simple interrogative, but also to express strong emotion,
anxiety‚ surprise, and indignation 16 16 used both alone and also in
combination with ut and ri. We shall give 6666676166, explaining as
we go along. 6. Simple interrogation: Stich. 1V. i 63, Sed 66166
ego tecum proficetur sum, Antipho? i. e. ‘have I made my peace with
you sufficiently l’ Most 1. iii. 10, Contempta, amabo, mea Scapha, ratris
boec me vestri 6666661 i. e. ‘look and tell me, Scapha, whether this
dress becomes me well enough i' and similar examples will be found
in Most. I. iii. 665, Pers. I. i. 68, Μ666. 11. iv. 67, Μ66. IV. ii 52,
V. i. 41· ln Men. IV. ii. 38, Satin audii? is avery earnest question,
