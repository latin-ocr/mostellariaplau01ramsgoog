130 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Medic. sac. 73, Nec cerussa ati, nec m’tre' spuma rubentes Desit, ct
Illyrica quae venit iris tuma but here it forms part of a complicated
recipe. We find the word cerussatus quoted from Cic. in Pison. XI.
(cerussataeque bracae, when describing the general appearance of
Gabinius), but all the MSS. here are corrupt, and present pulsatae,-
it occurs, however, in Martial VII. xxv. 2, Dulera cum tantum secedas
epigrammata semper Et cerussata candidiora cute. There is another
Ep. ol Mart. in which cersessa is mentioned, X. xxii, Cur splcmatc
saepe prodeam meato Albave pictus sana labra cerussa, Phelacuc‘, quam's?
bostare te nalo.

ros. Atramertum] when used to denote a black pigment, is what
we call lamellack, and the mode in which it was usually prepared
is distinctly described in Plin. H.N. XXXV. 6, b 25, Fs't mum efuls'ge'ne
pluribus meat, rescisa vel pice exustus, propter quod ettam ‹ffmieas aedefi-
cavere fumum eum nors emittentes. ct. Vitruv. VII. 10. Apelles and
Micon are said to have used atramentum made from the charcoal ol
grapestones, while Apelles also employed bone-black obtained from
ivory. (Plinio.) Atramentum ls'brars'sem, or writing-ink, was composed
by mining atramentum with gum, while in atramentum tectomiuu, for
stuccoing the walls os rooms, glue was the vehicle. (Vitruv. lc.)
Totally distinct from the atramentum described above was what the
Romans called atramentum teutonum, and the Greeks gallearum. This,
as is evident from the description os Pliny (H. N. XXXIV. 532), was
sulphate of iron, which, when applied to tanned leather, would stain
it black, forming exactly the compound which constitutes the common
writing ink os modern times*

- postules] i. e. ‘you may as well hy (expect) at the same time
to whiten ivory with lamp-black’ It is commonly set down in
books upon Latin Synonyms that postulo is the strongest of all the
verbs which signily ‘to seek’ or ‘to ask sor,' and that it denotes that
the person employing it peremptorily demands something to which
he has an unquestionable right. This is however by no means the
common force os the word when used colloquially. We shall find
agreat number os passages in the dramatists where it means simply
‘to desire,' ‘to want,’ or ‘to try to do something,’ and ‘to expect to
be ableto do;' in addition it sometimes conveys the idea that a

* When Cic. Epp. Fam. IX. ar, speaking of Cn. Carbo the particen
of Marius says, Iam pater es'us, accusatus a M. Antania, sutorio atramenta
absolutus putatur, he probably means that he poisoned himself with this
substance, but the explanation is uncertain. Galen rechons it among
