EXCVRSVS XVII.—TERMS OE ABUSE, dcc. 283

and Cas. 11. vi. 37, O. Taceo: Deos quaeso. . . C. Vt quedem tu hodie
canem et furcam seras! 0. Ms'hi ut sortitio eveniat. C. Vt widem,
hercle, pcds‘dus peridem 0. At tu ut oculos emungare ex capite per
nasum tuost ‘but Ipray that you may blow your eyes out through
your nosel’

4. Adiurats'oces. No one can fail to he struck by the multitude
of adjtuations with which the dialogue in Plautus and Terence is
interlarded, and which are, for the most part, mere expletives, desti·
tute of any particular emphasis, corresponding to the ‘Gad‚' ‘Bedad,'
‘Faith,' ‘By Jove,’ and a host of others, with which many of our
dramatists were wont to season the discourse of their characters.

The words of this kind which appear to have been most in favour
with the Romans were, as might be anticipated, appcals to their
popular deities, the Great Twin Brethren aud Hercules, expressed
by Pol, Edepol, Mecastor, Ecastor, Hercle, dec.

Pol is manifestly an abbreviation of Pollux, and is used either as
an independens ejaculation or in connection with verbs and such
adverbs as certe, sanc, profecto. The combination Per pol, found in
Hec. 1. i. 1, Per pol quam paucos repertas meretricibus lldcks evenire
matoes, Sura, is so strange that commentatore have sought to
explain it by mas, conjoining the per with quam.

Edepol has been held to be a contractiori for per aedem Pollucis,
and hence is sometimes printed aedepol, but it is probably merely
another form of Epol, which is found occasionally in the MSS. of
Plautus. Pol and Edepol in the extant Latin writers are freely used
by men and women alilre.

Mecastor, we cannot doubt, stands for mc, Castor, iuoa, or me
Castor suaet, ‘so help me, Castor,' as Meherculcs or Mehercule stand
for me, Hercules, aava, or rae Hercules suaet, and Medeicsfidius for nte,
Dius Fideles, aava, or me Dius didius suaet, ‘so help me, God of
Truth!

Ecastor, although explained like Edepol to be a contractiori for
per aedem Castores, seems to be simply the name Castor with the
ejaculatory particle e prefixed, as in Equirine (Paul. Diac. p. 81, ed.
Mun), Esioso (Charis p. 183, ed. Puta), and Epol, noticed above.

Heracle or Hercle* are the fonns in which the invocation of this
deity generally appears in Plautus and Terence; Metercte, although
not without example, is rare-Eun. 1. i. 22, llI. i. 26. The following
passage from Aulus Gellius, XI. 6, is curious: “ ln veteribus scriptis

* Cic. Orat. nvllo 157, “Et pomeridianas quadrigas quam postmeri-
dianas libentius dixerim, et nenena quam mehercules.”
