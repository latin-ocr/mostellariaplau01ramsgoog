noras. 1. r. 57. 105

may be'written as two distinct words, compendi'sace, lor the component
parts are frequently separated. The phrase facere aliquid com i
properly signifies, r. ‘to save ;' a. ‘to abridge;' and hence ‘to cut
short! Thus, Bac. 11. ii 6, Compendi multo verda ium socium tibi,
ie. ‘I shall make a long story short ior you,' ‘1 shall save you-
the trouble ol making a long speech! So Pseud. IV. vii. 42, Quis·
quis er, adulescens, operam sac compendi quaerere, ‘save yourseli the
trouble! Again, Truc. 11. iv. 26, Si quid tibi Compendi facere possim,
factum edepol oeli'iii, i. e. ‘if Ican make any saving ior you ;' and
Pers. IV. iii. a, Nam ego liodi'e compendi seci' binos prinei tudier, 'i e. ‘1
have made a saving os two loaves per day! The passive olfacio is
also used As. 11. ii. 41, Verbivelitationem fieri compendi volo, i. e. ‘I wish
this skinnishing of words to be cut short! Sometimes compendium
is put in the accusative, followed by a genitive or dative, Rud l.
ii. 90, Si od saxium quo capessil,* ea deormm cadit Erratiom'r fecerit
compendium, i. e. ‘she will have brought her wanderings to au
abrupt tennination‚' ‘save herself lrom all further wandering.’ In
Stich. Ι. iii. 39, Haec uerba subigunt me mores ut bardores Di'rcom,
atquc ut focium praeconii compendium, Itaque auctionem praedicem,
ipse ut uenditem, the reading, as lar as the last word is con-
cemed‚ is very doubtful. The Palatine MSS. are corrupt, but the
Palimpsest has preserved the true reading, and the meaning is
tolerably clear. The parasite says that he is about to have a sale
ol his property by auction alter the Roman lashion‚ and that he
william the expeim ol an auctioneer by acting in that capacity
himself. So facere compendium pultondi', ‘to cease irom,' Pseud. 11.
ii. 11. Again, in Capt. V. ii. 12, vvith the dative, Satis sticundus es,
redium fieri durii compendium uolo. Averb different from facere is
occasionally employed, Mil. 111. i.186,Quam potes trini verda confir
maxum nd cunpeiidium. And we have ponem ad compendium in Cas.
III. i. 3, 5, where poni'to ad compendium means ‘cut short by leaving
that out! See the passage. Finally, since, according to the proverb,
what is saved is gained, we find smero compendium signily ‘to make
an ,acquisition ;' Bac. I. ii. 51, Corripendium edepol, haud aetati¹ optabile,
Fecisti, mem iitonc noctus es impudentium where it must be regarded
as opposed to dispendium. And indeed this seems to lead to the
true meaning os the phrase, which seems to be, ‘to make a saving os,'
and hence, to ‘spate' ‘cut short,' compendium signilying a saving' or
contractiori of expenditure, just as dispendium signifies a lavish outlay.
