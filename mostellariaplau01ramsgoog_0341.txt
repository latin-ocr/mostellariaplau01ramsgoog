r. Correction of a positive blunder: Clst Il. i. 37, A. Itaque me
Iuno regina et Iovis ruprenu' stlta, Itaque me Saiurmtr paranetas.
M. Ecastor, pater. A. Itaque me Ops opulema r'lle'us avia. M. Ima,
maier quidem, ‘no, no, Ops was his mother, not his grandmother:’
here the correction of the first mistake is introduced by Ecastor.

Simple correction: Cist. 11. iii. aa, P. An, amalo, meretre'x alla ert,
quarellam autulii? L. Ima merariusus't. The last words must not

be translated ‘yes‚ she was} but the emphasis depende upon the
change of tense from the present est to the past fuit. Phanostrata
asks, ‘what, tell me‚1beg, is that woman who brought him up an
hetaeral' to which Lampadius replies, ‘n0, she is not, but she was:
she isan old woman now!

The use of eina in the following passage must be ranlred under this ’
head; Eun. 111. i. 17, Thraso is boasting of the confidence reposed
in him by the Rex whom he served, and gaeson, Τ. Tum me eon·
tubam solum abducebat siti. G. Hui! Regem elegantem narrar. T. Ima
sic homo est Perpaucorum hominum. G. Iota mulorum arbritor, Si
lecum orori: here, in each case, roro introduces aeorreetion: G. ‘Yon
describe a lring fastidious in the choice of his associates,' to which
Thraso, all unconscious of the contemptuous irony of Gnath0, replies,
T. ‘Nay (you must not suppose that he has many associatae), such
as he is towards me (although treating me with the highest distinc-
tion), he is one who bestows his friendship on very few mem' on
which Gnatho remarks aside, ‘nay, (say rather) on none at all, if he
lives with you,' the emphasis being on aularum ianuarum, ‘on none
who deserve the name of men, if you are a sample of his favourites'

a. Again, imo is often used to correct and improve some expres·
sion, the correction frequently consisting in the substitution of a
strong word for a wealr one3 Eun. IV. vii. 41, T. Ouid nunc agionis?
G. Quen redeamus: tam haec libi aderit supplicans tarro. T. Credin?
G. Ima cerle, novi eugenium mulierum: here emo certe does not mean
‘yes‚ assuredly,’ but iou is introduced with reference to the word
credin, which implies a certain degree of doubt. The true translation
is, therefore, T. ‘Do you believe thatl' G. ‘(Believe it l) no, no,
l‘believe' is too wealr a word.) I am sure of it 3⁹ Phor. 1. ii. 95,
D. Non maltum habel Quod detsorlarse. G. Imo namt, nisi spem mam,
which we must render, D. ‘Perhaps he has not much to give! G. ‘No,
(mulum is not the word) he has nothing ;' Eun. II. iii. 36, C. Is,
dum sequor hanc, fit muliebrium. P. Incommode, hercle. C. Ima emm·
oera infeliciter, Nom incommoda alra sunt delenda, Panaetio. Imo refers
to incommode. ιΝο, ‘incommode' is not the word, you should have
