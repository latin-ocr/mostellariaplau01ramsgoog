METRE AND PROSODY. lxxv

that several words which are not comprehended in the definition
appear to violate the Law oi Position.

3. This we shall give in the words of Bentley, as he claims the
doctrine as original: “Illud tantum monebo, quod ante me opinor
nemo—ln primo iere versuum pede, et parcius alias, Licentiam
hanc exercuisse Nostrumz* idque rectissimo iudicio: cum Actor,
in fine prioris versus anima recepta, plenum rapidumque spiritum
posset effundere.'' He then quotes thirty-eight examples from
Terence.

Here again the observation, although Just to a certain extent, is
stated too strongly. There are many examples oi this licence at
the beginning ol a line, but we cannot say that they are even conr·
paratively rare in other parts os the verse. The explanation seems
altogether fancilul.

We may now consider the opinion oi Hermann, and this is
deserving of the most caresul study and the greatest respect on
account of his proiound scholarship, singular acuteness, and the
special attentimr which he devoted throughout his long lile to
metrical topics. His views may be gethered from a number of
passages in his great work, the Elementa Doctrinae Metram, but
they are distinctly and tersely enunciated in his Epilona Doctrinae
Μείνιὶαε, and seem to have undergone no change during the long
period which elapsed between the publication oi the first edition
and the appearance ol' the third in 1852, the words in both (ᾗ 79)
being the same:-

“Apud Latinos duplex recitatio in usu sultuna accentum max-
ime vocabtdorum et vulgarem pronuntiationem sequens, qua scenici
veteres usi sumt, altera ad Graecorum exemplum conformata, quae

ab Ennio primum in epicam poesin, Augusti aevo in omnia fere
genera poeseos introducta est. Scenica illa recitatio abundat cor·
reptionibus, neque curat positionem, unde ille, atque, th'hppi, raven·
tunt et alia plurima correptis ante duplicem consonantem vocalibus

pronuntiantur. Quin etiam vocales longas corripiunt, ubi ultima
eliditur ut concede huc, secede huc.”

It will be observed that in the above passage a lact is stated and
an explanation given. lt is stated as a lact that the dramatists
neglect the Rule of Position (this without limitation), and that they
moreover in certain cases shorten vowels naturally long. The
explanation proposed is that there were two modes oi pronouncing
Latin3 theone natural, natinaei, and familiar to all3 the other
