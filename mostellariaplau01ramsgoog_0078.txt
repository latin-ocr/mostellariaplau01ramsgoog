METRE ΛΝΒ PROSODY. lix

Nay, examples such as the following, if genuine, would go to prove
that a whole Tetrameter might be made up of Molossi alone :-

Amph IL ii. 20,
Ef patria et* prognata, tumber, amamur.
and Poen Ι. ii. 9,
Postquam aurora t’lluxz‘t, numquam concessamus’t

In addition to the Bacchius and the Molossus this verse permits
of the resolutiones the first syllable of the Molossus, and thus the
lonic a minore (υ υ - -) finds a place, but is used much more
sparingly than either the Bacchius or the Molossus :-

ln ,

m Metuo loc ndbisyff quiquidem lucc venminus.
1¹¹ md, Soror, cogito, melo, ilem nos perhiberi.
1113ῐὼ &umquam haudfaha sum nos ddidsde haberi
Nam multum loquaces mirlfo omnis habemus.
In ab, Tun me, valera, audes herum ludlflcdri.
Lastly, either of the long syllables of the Bacchius may be resolwed,

and then we shall 'obtain the fourth Paeon (υ υ o -) and the second

Paeon (υ - υ o) as feet available in any place except the 4th,
from which the second Paeonis excluded: thus-

Quam si saled marialdo esse ostentantur.
Neque eis ulla ornandi satis sauctae esf.
Novarum aedilem esse arbitror similent ego liminius.

According to what has been said above the scheme of the Bacchiae
Tetrameter will be as follows :-

* To be scanned Bt atry' er.

† So Hermann, but Me text la very doubtful.

Ι This is the doctrine of Hermann, which has generally been ,adopted
by metricai scholars, but l have serious doubts as to the admissrbrlity of
the fourth and second Paeon. ln the first of the ,examples gwen above,
martura might be pronounced miniaco, and this actually takes place
some lines lower down-so, rdtwtas may become suffitae, saulem may
become sonum, and bemineru may be boirnem.
