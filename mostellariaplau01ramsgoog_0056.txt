ORTHOGRAPHY. axani

worthless, because the writers would in most cases represent the
orthography prevalent in their own day.

Where the question an'ses as to the insertion or omission of an
aspirata at the beginning of a word, or between two vowels, we have
absolutely nothing to gulde us; but in so far as Plautus is con-
cemed we might be safe in omitting it atheromata and in writing
Cannam, Corrago, Anhbcos, Agaloclos, BACANAE [10qaater], Pulcer,
BRACIVM [12], Aroleclur, repulerunt, teatrum, traiampuu although
we could scarcely bring ourselves to adopt the form Pa‘la'pus, which
is found on a coin, especially as Philippus appears on other pieces
belonging apparently to the same epocb3 and, generally speaking, in
proper names, and especially those of foreign origin and rare occur·
rence, we cannot loola for accuracy, or adhere to Latin rules; and
hence we may retain the Greek spelling, and adopt Philolaches, Phila·
mano, and Ihmropr‘dcs, instead os Pt'loloces, Palemolr'um, T carmos.

In sofar as the rule of Quintilian is concemed it is closely
observed in inscriptions. We have indeed an aspirate before a
vowel at the commencement of a few words which discarded the
aspirate at a later period, such as HARENATO, n. 557, HOLI·
TOR, n. 1057, HERVCINA, n. 14953 on the other hand, it does
not appear in EREDES, ιι. 1034, OSTIA, n. 819, ARRESPEX,
n.1348, ERCEISCVNDA [19 his]⁸ The only violation of the
precept which forbids the use of the aspirate after a consonant, in
a word not a proper name, is sEPvLcHan) in n. 1107 (but
there is nothing to rix the date of this inscription with certainty), and
the proper name, PHlSIDAE, which occurs in 18, lac. 71, but
which is evidently a mere blanden since the word (PISIDAE)
appears in its correct form repeatedly in the same inscription.
PVLCHER, as al proper name, appears on aDenarius minted in
all probability towards the close of the Republic, on some coins
amuli in Asia, and on a fragment of sculpture found at Eleusis.

Q.

Although q was never extensively employed hythe Romans, it
certainly was employed commonly, at an early period, in certain
words in which it was afterwards supplanted by c. Foremost among
these is PEQVNIA, which is written with a q in the great majority
of cases in the oldest inscriptions, although, curiously enough, the
first example of the word is in 1o, where it appears as PECVNIAM.
Thus PECVNIA and its cases take aQ about twenty-aix times in ll·
