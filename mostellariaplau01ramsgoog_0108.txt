METRE AND PROSODY. lxxxix

Philippus, and others, must be considered to afford instances of the
violation of that rule. We shall examine in detail the most remarlr·
able of these examplcs, and show how insufficient rs the evidence
they afford to support the theory that has been built upon them.

The word pm'stronrata occurs twice.
ι. In Stich.11.ii. 54, upon which nothing can be founded, for

the MSS„ including the Palimpsest, are in the greatest confusion.
The vulgate, which is due to Camerarius,

Tum Babulom'ca murmurantesque tapetm,
may be readily scanned as a Troch Tetr. Cat. without doing violence
to the obvious quantity of peristromata. Weise has-

Tum Babulom‘ca pabtromta, cortchulrbta tapetta
which may also be scanned as aTroch. Tetr. Cat. by pronouncing
combusta. Ritscbl has-

T um Babylonica penitromatrit cmlyliata tapeta,
which is less plausible than either of the preceding.

a. The second example isin Pseud I. ii. 13,
Vr ne perdlromata quinem aeque picta seht Camponica.

Here the MSS. present no important variation, and the Vulgare,
W„ and R. acquiesce in the same reading. Editors have regarded
this as a Troch. Tetr. Cat, in which case it is impossible to scan it
without considering that the three first syllables of peristromata form
an Anapaest5 but the line may be scanned without difficulty and

without violating the ordinary rules of quantity as an Iambr‘c iitro-
meter Acatalectr'c, and it cannot be objected that an lambic verse is
here intruded into a series of Trochaics, for the measure in this
passage changes in almost every line, and Iambic Tetrameters

immediately follow the verse in question. According to the arrange·
ment of W„ we have from the commencement of the scene—

v. 1-5. Tetr. Spondiaci Acat

6. Dimeter Creticus.

7-9. Cretici Tetram.

ιο. lamb. Tetr. Hyperm.

ιι, 12. Troch. Tetr. Acat

13, 14. Troch. Tetr. Cat.

¹5·²9· Tetram. lamb. partim hest partim Cat partim Hypercst.

There is nothing therefore startling or unnstural in supposing that
v.14 is an lamb. Tetr. Acat instead of Troch. Tetr. Cat.

Another example quoted is the word expoptluto, found in Mil IV.iv.44‚

Id cormexum r'n lumem laeuo expapillalo brocha
