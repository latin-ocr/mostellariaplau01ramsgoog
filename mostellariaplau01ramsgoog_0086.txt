METRE AND PROSODY. lxvii

be longor short at pleasure, aud a hiatus may be freely admitted3
thus Cas. ΙΙ. ἰί. 29,

Quin usia aut suptrahal ΙΙ aad stupro caunum·
and a. 16, ’

Νιι mitre· cicc meum ΙΙ optinendi opha cst;
and Rud. lV. iii. 12,

Sed barti consili ΙΙ ecquid in te mihi ειη·
where superatae, c'uc meum, aad cacerr'li, although each is followedby
avowel, stand for Cretics. In so lar as the hiatus is concamed, we
may remark that it is not unfrequently neglected in other parts oi
the verse.

The following passage will afford a good example oi the Cretic
Tetrameter Acar. ; it is from Cas. 111. v. 1-

Nulla sum, nulla nam! Tala, tola accedi!

Car nictu marmana est: membra antherae* tremunt,

Nescia unde auxili, praemiii, perfugi

Mi, aut mum centiam comparem aul expetam:

Tanta sachi mado mt‘ra mc'rt's modis

Intrl aridi nouam atque integram audactam

Cave† tibi, Cleostrata :l apscede ab cita, opsecro,

Νι qaid in te mali faxit ilai perata.
The Cretic Tetrameter Catalectic occurs here and there in detached
lines. Hermann arranges seven in succession in Trin. II. i. 1743,

but several ol these cannot be scanned without conjectura} emenda·
tions3 one presents no difficulty, and may serve as an example-

Da nich? hoc, m'el anum, si me amas, si audes,·

see also what is said below on Most. l. iv.

Cretics combined wilh Trachees.

Lines are occasionally found in Plautus which belong unquestionably
to the class oi Cretica, but which terminate in a peculiar manner.

* Fourth Paeon in 3rd place, unless we pronounce misrae.

† Cave, a monosyllable, pronounced Gau.

iCleonaeaetrisyllable,pr0nouucedClostrata. ,

§ Fourth Paeon in 3rd place. Ita is a conjecturat emendation, for the
MSS. have ira, but it is not satisfactory. The next line, which concludes
the speech oi Pardalisca, seems to be a Choriambic Tetrameter heah,-

Eripite isti gladium ἵέιαι sui est inmas animi. ·
