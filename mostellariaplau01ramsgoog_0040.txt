ORTHOGRAPHY. xxi

But when Cornutus, in the passage quoted above, enjoins· us to
write coroa, and adds, “nec quemquam moveat antiqua scriptura
nam et occursare per duo SS scripsemnt,” and when Mar. Wct.
asseris that the antiqui wrote such words as ausus, causa, farus,
odabsacs, with a double S, aursus, ac, we infer from the passage in
Quintilian, quoted above, that antr'qua scnptura and antiqui indicate

not the predecessors ol Ennius, but the cotemporaries ol Cicero and
Virgil.

The passage from Mar. Vict. on the same topic is such acurious
mass ol confusion and contradiction, that we have quoted it at length
above, to avoid the suspicion of misrepresenting his meaning. From
this it will be seen that he enunciates three propositions: (1) that the
aau'qui did not double consonants at all ; (2) that when it was neces·
sary (oportebat) to double a consonant, they placed a mark called
a Sicilicus over the consonant to be doubled; (3) that the ana'qui
ai'd double the consonants in words quoe presnbre sono eduntur, such
as muas, causo, &c Nisus says the same thing with regard to the
Sicilicus, but is very properly censured by Veleia Largus, who remarks
that there is in reality no difference between doubling a consonant
and placing amarlr over a single consonant, to point out that it was
to be pronounced as double. But the curibus circumstance con·
nected with these statements is, that among all the inscriptions
preserved, no trace ol any mark corresponding to what is called the
Sicilicus can be discovered.

Moreover, the ancient grammarians frequently state their own sancies
and conjectures and theories as il they were acknowledged laets.
Thus Cornutus, in the passage already quoted, partially leads us to
infer that the use oi the double S in such words as satire, dabriisse,
esre, and caruarsc, was an anta'qua scriptura as much as accurrere,
whereas in point ol fact these words were uniformly written witha
double S, except in the very earliest times. With equal recldessness
Velius Longus, l.c., asserta that the verb narro ought to be spelled
with a single R, because it is derived from garario!
