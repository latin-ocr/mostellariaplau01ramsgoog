NOTES.

1. i. r. Exi. e ,jeruel Ol the two forms ol the word signilyinga
door, sora ol the first declension, andsorr's ol the third, the former
is found only in the accusative plural foras, and the ablative plural
sorti, and these are by some grammarians designated as adverbs.
We may say a few words upon each.

Funus-lst. ln the great majority of cases in which fieres is
employed it is combined with a verb which implies the movement ol
the person or thing addressed or spoken ol from the interior oi a
house to the door. The verbs generally used are, foras ire, abire,
exire, exsurgere, effugere, efferre, educere, seducere, de erre, excludere,
extrudere, excire, exer'tare, er'cere, vocure, evocare, egredr] progredi,
pellere, edere se, proruere se*, prosepeu’, and the lile. Less common
but still conveying the same idea, Trin. ll. ii. r, Quo illic horno
seras se penetravit ex aedibus? Eun. II. iii. 66, Heme quatietur certe
curn dene sorae, ‘hurled, kicked οιιῐ]Ι Sometimes the expression is
figurative without reference to a door, as in Rud. Ι. ii. 82, fluctus eiecit
seras, ⁴ the wave has cast her forth ;' and Truc. Ι. i. 18, Pisces. . eduxit
sorus, os drawing fish out ol a pond in a net; and in Most. llI. i. 68
(64), abiresoras is ‘to go to aloreign land ;’ and still stranger, Phor. V.
vii. 65, Vides peccalum tmen esse delatumsoras, ‘carried out,' ie. ‘has
been hinted abroad, has been disclosed.' and. The idea os motion
outwards, although always implied‚ is in one or two phrases much less
direct. Thus since uocarr'ad cenumsoras means ‘to be invited out to
dinner,' so premetteresoras adeersum means ‘to accept such an invita·
tion,' ‘to promise to go out to dinner.’ Thus Rud V. iii. 64, Neve adeo
vocaus credam vos esse ad cerum seras ,· and Most. IV.iii.1u (iv. ιι),
Promrse'soras Ad cenam, ne me le vocure censeas,· and Stich. IV. ii. 16,

¹⁸¹ ln Eun. 111. v. μ, Foras simul omnes ,eruemur se is used with reference
to persons hurrying out ol a roorn in the interior ol a house ιιι order to

proceed into another apartment.
