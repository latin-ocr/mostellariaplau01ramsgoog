METRE AND PROSODY. oie

Age erge, epeerual Si peccesne multem hic retinebo e'le'ce. ’ ·

So the MSS.; R omits age, but age ergo may be regarded as a
short, sharp, colloquial expression, and, as such, liable to be curtailed
when enunciated. Poen. 1V. ii. 71 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Facile—Fae ergo id facile noscam, ut c'lle possit noscere, ¹

where sae ergo id must form a Spondee, or, as W. seems to think, an

, Anapaest. It will be observed that quid ergo, age ergo, sacerge,

are expressions ail belonging to the same class.

With regard to quippe, Lind says, “Quippe duobus locis Plauti
correptum reperitur, quare de eius correptione dubitatur.” The
passages to which he refers are probably-As. 1. i. 51 (Senar.),

Quippe qui mage onec'co utantur grate et benevolo,

atine which Fleck. brackets as spurious ; Epid. V. i. 12 (Troch.
Ten. Cae),

Hebe buum antheum—Queppe ego quoi libertos in mundo -’
n'ta est,

which is referred to in the index oi W, but erroneously, sor the line

scans perfectly without altering the natural form of quippe· and Men
IV. ii. 17 (Senon),

Quippe qui pro illes loquantur, mole quae fecerint.

This is in aCanticum, where W. has picked out a couple of Senarians
from-the midst- of a number oi Bacchiacs and Cretico os varying
dimensione. The distribution is most uncertain.

111. We now come to the consideration os those words, the quantity
os which, as used by Plautus, differs from that observed by later
writers. Considering that quantity depends upon pronunciation, we
might have expected to find a number of words, the pronunciation,
and therefore the quantity, of which had undergone achange during
the ¹50 years which elapsed from the period when Plautus ilourished
to the last days of the Republic. But these are in fact very sew.

Acheron, or, according to the earlier orthography, Acheruns,
and its derivatives‚ have the first uniformly short in Lucretius and
Virgil: Lucret. 1. 120,

. Er si praeurea tomen esse Acherusio templa,·
m· 37, Et melus ille soros praecept Acherunta agundces,·

Virg. Aen. VII. 312,
Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronte movebo,-
