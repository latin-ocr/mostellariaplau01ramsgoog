METRE AND PROSODY. xcv

where the difficulty may at once be removed, by introducing, as
proposed by Bothe, r'ndu, the old form ol in.
a. v. 140 (Senam,

Nunc toda Amphitruo venri! huc ab exeraiu.

Bothe maintains that as hic and hoc pronouns are of doubtful
quantity, the same holds good in the earlier poeta with regard to

hic and luc adverbs, although this is opposed to the dictum os the ·

grammarians. Il we have achoice ol difficulties, lew will hesitate
to make hirc short rather than exarcatu.

3. 1. iii. 6 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Sed udi summus rhmnator non adest ad exaratum.

W. gets rid os the difficulty by proposing to read uentu, but
unfortunately there seems to be no authority ior this form. I would
suggest that the true reading is—

Sed ubi summus unarum non adest exarcatu,

where exercitu is the dative. Some half-learned transcriher mistoolr
this sor exercuti, i. e. excreatum, and then the ad was inserted to
complete the construction.

Weise, in his Index (first edition), gives four additional examples

of exeratur with the ix short, all os them from the Amphitruo.
r. Prol. 102 (Senes),

Is preterquam hinc abrit r'prmet r'n exercitum,

where the line scans persectly with a Spondee in the auh place and
aTribrach in the fourth.
a. I. i. 245 (T roch. Tetr. Cat),

Qui cum empturum lac aaa theram in extraham,

where W. leaves the last syllable in rherum unelided, and supposes
the first in exeruimn to be short. It is quite as simple to suppose
that cram is not elided, in which case the line scans easily with an
Anapaest in the sixth place.

3. 11. ii. ror (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Neque meum pedem huc eatuli caiam r’n aedes, ut cunr exercitu.

There are several ways in which the line may be scanned without
shortening the first iu exercitu : pidem may be pronounced as a
monosyllable‚ and then totally elided ; or huc may be taken as short ;
or we may leave cum unelided; or we may resort to a simple trans·
position, and read Neque pedem nteum.
