valeatve ornam? Pa. acetosum hercle ordi et mammosam, Num·
qeeam auam nobam metit, quom operetur, treet: Quomque illa nutu
clanensium adme exit, tacet ,· and at the end oi the same scene, o. 93,
Vide! ut aperrientur aedessestrire‘ssumael Non mutr't cordo. Est lepidus.
P. Quia das maneam? and again in the same play, Ι. iii. r, Placide·
egredere, et samium prohibe serrum, et crepitum cardinum· and Trin V.
i 8, sedsores Hae sonata suo milei moram smmiemt r'neommode. Some
oi the older commentatore however imagine that the doors of the
dweliing houses opened ontwards directly upon the street, so that
every one who issued forth rattled the door before opening it, ia
order to give wanting to passers by. According to this view, when,
in o. 75, Tranio is endeavouring to irighten Theuropides and to
malie him believe that the outraged ghost is about to sally forth, he
exclaims, Concrepuit soris! Hiceem percurret? ie. ‘the door rattlesi
was it he (the ghost) who smote on it ι’

42. Sermonem nostrum qoiaacupee] Plautus is fond os the meta-
phor derived from the watchiul stillness and artifices of a bird-catcher;
so As. V. ii 31, Aucupemres ex rhsrdr'is clanmelum qaam rem gerant:
Mil IV. i. 43, Viden tre illam oculei venaturam faeere, otqree auaept’eon
trieribus,⁸ so ii. 53 Men. lV. i. 12, Huc concedamus: ex rirsr'dr'is wespa·
Rud. IV. iv. 49, Vellem scelestus at aucupatur, ‘is playing off his lures3’
Truc. V. 72, Lepode mecastor aucupavi, ‘l have had capital sport'

44. Capitalis caedri facta est] ie. ‘an atrocious murder vas
committed! Caedis is another torm os the more common nomi·
native caedes, as we lind aedis for aedes, torquis ior torques, and cam's
and canes. The epithet capitalis is emphatic, since caedes or caedo
would not, taken alone, necessarily imply murder. Young scholare

are apt to be embarrassed by the word capitales. As there is awant i
oi distinctness in some even os our best dictionaries in regard to the =

modifications oi meaning assumed by this word, and their connection

with each other, we shall say a ievv words on the subject. Caput ι
’ signifies* (ι) ‘the head! (a) The head being regarded by many

ancient physiologists as the seat os the vital pn'nciple, Caput denoted
‘the life! (3) Caput was used by the jurists to designate ‘the poli-

tical life’ os a Roman citizen, and comprehended the whole amount ’

oi his privileges as a free man, as a member ol a family, and as a
erite's optemo nere. Hence when an individual irom any cause suffered
the loss os these privileges, oroi any portion ol thern, he was said

*We notice here those leading meanings only of caput which are
