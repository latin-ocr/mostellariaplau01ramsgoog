giving one absurd etymology (quasi anguiportus, ie. angusta et curva
via), goes on, “Alii, quod inter portus sit locus angustus, hoc est inter
domos. Nam domas, vel portus vel assulas veteres dixenmt.”

indicating the hurry and confusion of the narrator.

28. Vel bonarium sabe aedis mancupr'o poscere] Since hommem in
a. 26 refers to Simo, it might appear harsh to make homrisem in this
line refer to Philolaches, and to translate ‘order Philolaches to de-
mand ;' but we may regard homrirem aedis as the double accusative
after poscere, ‘order (your son) to make a demand upon theman
(Simo) for the house! The emendation poem proposed by Dousa
and adopted by Bothe and Weise, is not sanctioned by any MS, and

circumstances, it afterwards turned out that he did not really possess
any such right, then he was bound to reimhurse the purchases* It'
however the slave was sold without muncupata, then the buyer made
the purchase suc perz'culo, at his own risk‚ and had no recourse upon

‘the seller. Thus in the Persa, where the plot tums upon the fraudulent ,
