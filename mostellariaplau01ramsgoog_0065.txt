employed the designatius of D paragoge-ma term as irrational as
that ol ἰφσλκυστικόν in Greek.

It appears chiefly in datives and abladves, but by no means
exclusively, and Charisius goes so far as to essert that in ancient
times it was attached to all words ending with a vowel. Thus, in
lwe have GNAIVOD; and in n. 63, 64, DE PRAIDAD3 n. 181,
AIRE MOLTATICOD; n.190, MERITOD; 10 abounds in ex·
amples, such as SENTENTIAD ter, OQVOLTOD, POPLICOD,
PREIVATOD, CONVENTIONID. These are all ablatives, but we
have in the same inscription, EAD, ace. pl, EXTRAD, FACILV·
MED, SED for SE (the pronoun), SVPRAD ter. Charisius, p. 87,
specially quotes ted from Plautus, and the forms nied and fed occur
‚ repeatedly in the MSS. of the plays. Indead, some scholars have
imagined that by a free introduction ol d at the end of words ending
with a vowel, we might escape from the embarrassment felt by
metrieal scholars on account of the constant recurrence of lriatus.

It is evident however, from our oldest inscriptions, that in the
early part of the sixtb century, although the use of the D para-
gogs'cum had not fallen entirely into disuse, it was not generally

employed, and hence any attempt to introduce iton an extensive ·

scale into the text of Plautus would be unjustiliable.

Faisal M and Fs‘rral S.

That final m was but faintly pronounced is evident from the fact
that a final syllable ending in m was elided before aword begimring
with a vowel in all ages of Latin poetry. The same took place
frequently in words ending in ils or is, in the earlier ages of Latin
poetry3 the practice was still common in the age of Lucretius, but
aflerwsrds fell into disuse. Hence it is not surprising that, in the
older class of inscriptions, final nt is frequently ondtted3 and the
same holds good, but to a smaller extent, in final s also.

As instances of the dropping of final m we have OMNElm) [1],

practice becomes more and more rare, and finally disappesrs. From
the first, however, it was by no means uniformly observed: thus,
