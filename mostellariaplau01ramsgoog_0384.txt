that obsecro, like amabo, is not unfrequently followed by the accu-
sative of the person appealed to, but more frequently does not talre
a case, and is in many instances a mere exclamation. ln Heaut.
IV. i. 31 it is construed with a double accusative, Mt' Chreme, peccave,
faleor, vzhcor, nunc hoc te opsecro,· and in Pers. 1. i. 49 the entreaty is
strengthened by the addition of renero—Opsecro tc, resecm, operam da
hunc mihi fidelem.

Perhaps it is scarcely worth remarking that while amabo recurs
again and again in Pleume, obsecro is found in comparatively few
passages while Terence evinces a decided preference ior obsecro over
amada· quaeso is more common, in proportion, in Plautus than in
Terence; sodes is used upwards ol a dozen times in the six plays oi
Terence, and not more than five or six times in the twenty plays
of Plautus. Sullas does not ocem in Terence ; it is quoted by Festus
(pp. 301, 343, ed. Muli.) irom Plautus, Cat0, and Ennius.

1. Talentum, Mina Brachma, Obolus. As might be expected,
considering the source from which the works ol Plautus and Terence
, are derived, the sums oi money mentioned in their plays are, sor
the most part, calculated according to the Greek system ol Talents,
Minae, and Drachmae.

We may reinind the young scholar that these terms all denoted
certain weights, and that although the absolute value os each differed
in different states, their mutual relation was invariable. Mzha may
be represented in all cases hy the English word Pound but as the
Avoirdupois Pound differs from the Troyes Pound, and both from
the Italian Pound, so the Mina oi Athens was different in absolute

weight from the Mina ol AEgina, and both differed from the Mina
