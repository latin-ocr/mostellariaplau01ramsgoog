107,118. offlectam. Fura] Fucur, according to Pliny H. N. XIIL
25, ll& is ageneral term for marine shrubs, and he tells us that the
latin language has no word equivalent to the Greek φῦκος, muman
alga herbanum ntagr's cumulum talelhgilur, lic aulem es! frutex. He
goes on to describe three species growing on the rocks by the sea
shore, one of these a native of Crete* and elsewhere speaks of
it as communicating a very fast red colour to wool. There cau be
little doubt that Pliny, or at least hia authorities, intended to indicate
by the word sucus some of the tinctorial lichens, of which a con-
siderable number are found upon maritime rocks in the Mediterranear,
and even on our own shores, especially those which yield the red or
purple colours, and form the principal constituents of the dyc stuli
known as orchrl. The most celebrated of these is the roccella lr'rrc-
lona, which many modern writers have supposed to be identicol with
the πόντιον φῦκος of TheophrastuS, the φῦκος θαλάσσιον of DioscorideS,
the phycos thalassina or sucus of Pliny. Dioscorides denies that the
paint used by women was made from this plant, and asserta that it
was a root bearing the same name, and hence in our dictionaries we
find it frequently stated that sucus means the anchusa hurmio or
alknnet root. Α German botanist (Endlicher) has recently maintained
that the fucus of the ancient was obtained from one of the algae,
the rylt'pllaea citatorio, from which a red colour can be extracted.†
Hence the word fucus is used to signify generally a dye or pigment,
chiefly red, from whatever source obtained, as in the passage before

* And yet in XXXII. 6, ξ aa, he terms this very plant an alga—Lauda·
tissima (algo maris, sc.) quae r'n Creta insula iuxta terram ιἰι petris nascitur,
lr'n ' etiam lanis ita colorem adligans, ut elui postea non possil,· and in
X v1. 10,§ 66, he mentions the medicinal proper-ties of the same planu,
which he comprehends under the name of phycos thalassina idest sacas

marinus, describing the three varieties and alluding to Crete as the habitat
of that used ln dyeing.
