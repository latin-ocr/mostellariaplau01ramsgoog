110 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

flourished after Augustus, as Freund asserts in his Lexicon, for Varro
R. R. 111. 17 says that Hortensius kept a body of fishermen in his
pay to furnish the precious inhabitants. of his ponds (photiae) with
little fishes, and that when the weather was so tempestuous that they
could not bring to shore in their uets nebant sagittam, then he supplied
them with morsels oi salted fish (salsamnta), where orbam segitem
must signify ‘living food,’ in contradiction to the salsensem or
pickled tunny.* Henoe we have the verb sagittare, ‘to fatten,' sagi-
natus and rogitemus,- and Varro R. R. 111. ro supplies us with the
term sagittantur for a ‘fattening coop! This being premised we
may pass on to examine the three passages in Plautus, in addition
to that before us, where the word is found. 1. Most. Ι. iii. 78 (77),
Ieme rita quedem anaspia res erit, dies noctoque estur, bibitur Ne·
que quitquam parsimoniam adhibet,¹ sagetia plane ert, which the older
commentatore explain, ‘the place is a regular fatting coop,’ making
ragiba=rageirareieen But this is quite unnecessary‚ and we may keep
to the strict sense, ‘it is a clear case oi stuffing and cramming!
Again, a. Trin. ΠΙ. ii 96, where Stasimus, speaking of his master as
about to enter the service of some foreign prince, says, Aut elegum
ad regem in regebam teres se coue'ecit maes, i. e. ‘in order that he may
grow fat at his cost;' and we have a parallel to this in Cicero pro
Flacco vll, Nuper pedat} partib ante omni largitione emman, Per-
gamem, quod Mithradates, qui mutitudinem etam non aucton'tate sed
sagena tenebat, se nelle deicit, id sudores, id zonarii conclamarant. Cf.
also Tacit. H. II. 71. 3. The third example is in Mil ΙΙΙ. ii. 31,
where a drunlten slave, who had been stealing wine, says that libis
misdeeds are discovered, Postea rogabo ego a'cxbr cellariis, where the
term sagena cellaria, being evidently a whimsical phrase coined to
raise a laugh‚ must not be pressed too closely. But none of these
throw any light upon the phrase before us. B has sagnam caedite,
the rest cedite. Lambinus adopts cedite and explains it date, that is,
give me food for my oxen. But this would involve a false quantity,
for in that case cedite must be regarded as equivalent to cette and
connected with cedo, ‘give me,' and then it would be impossible to
scau the line. Weise renders the words by ce'bos concedite, than which
nothing could be more tame. Forcellini finds away out oi the difficulty
by assigning a special meaning to regrina, of which this passage affords
the only example, viz. eptam animal sagena pebqwsactum, in which
case we might render the line, ‘ceteram yourselves, slay the fatted

* The passage in Propert. lV. viii. 25 is not decisive.
