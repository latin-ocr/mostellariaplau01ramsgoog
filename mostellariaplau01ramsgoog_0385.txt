ol Alexandria But in these and in all other places where the same
denominations were employed,

1 Talent = 60 Minae.

r Mina = 100 Drachmae.

1 Draehma = 6 Obols

llloreover, throughout Greeee and her colonies in Asia and Africa,

when money was concerned, a Talent denoted sixty pounds' neight
ol silven* a Mina one pound weight os silver, and a Druehma
T&yth ol a pound neight ol silver3 but since the absolute weight ol'
the Mina varied in different districts, the actual money value ol a
Tolent, a Mina, and aDraehma varied in like proportion. Of these

three denominations the Drachma alone was acoin; no pieee ol the i

weight oi a Talent or even oi a Mina was ever minted for circulation.
The heaviest Greek coin known is a Decadracm the most common
are Tetradrechms and Didrachms,† and the Atheniens coined silver
pieces as low as aquarterobol, or 5¹3th ol a Drachma.

In the works of the Latin dramatists all computatione in Greek
money must be referred to the Attio standard, and wherever mode-
rate sums are named we shall not commit any grave error ii we
consider the salue ol the

Attio Drachma = od. sterling.

Since the Atheniens employed silver as the standard of their
costeney, wherever we find the words Talentum or Mina in Plautus
or Terence they uniformly denote respectively a sum ol 6000 and
and 100 Drachmae‚ the word argenti being sometimes added and
sometimes omitted. Thus when we read in Mero. IV. iii. 4, Hrrn
quai decent talenta datis detuli,· and in Heaut. V. i. 67, Dua talenta
pro re nostra ego esse decrevi satit, the same Talent is indicated as
when it is said, Phor. V. iii. 6, ex iris praedm talenta argenti bina
Statim capiebat‚· and in Mete Prol. 88, Talentum argenti ipim sua
adnumerat manu: in the latter passage it is clearly implied that the
value ol a Talent was counted out in silrer coin3 and so As. 1-. iii 41,
Si nn'hi dantur dna talerrta argenti nnnrrrata in manunt.

But the expression Talentum magnum, which occurs frequently in

as require to be· noticed here.
tThis is to be understood os the Greek coinage in general—the Di·
drachms of Athens are extremely rare.
