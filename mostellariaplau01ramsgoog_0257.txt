to think that‚' it indicates strong indignation. ln this and in many
other cases, where satin and satin ut occur, Weise considers that they
may be expressed by the simple nonne; but it will be found upon cx-
amination that in many places nonne would very inadequately express
the force, and in others it is altogether out of place. Lastly, we have
satin εἰ, thus Rud. IV. v. 3, Satin, ri quoi homini dei esse derusoctum
volunt Aliquo illud pacto optingit optatum piis? i. e. ‘is it not manifest
that if the gods,' &c.; while in Pseud. Ι. i. 110, Satin est si hanc
hodie neminem efficio tibi Tua ut siti i. e. ‘are you content ifi’

1. ii. a. Argumenta] Argumentum isproperly (see note on 1. i. a)
‘something which pierces and carries conviction with it,' hence ‘a
proof’ hence ‘reasoning,' hence ‘a discussion' or ‘dissertation’ in
which argumenta are adduced, and hence the ‘subject or'theme ot' a
discussion or dissertation! It is from the idea of movement implied
in reasons which ‘pierce and carry conviction with them,’ that ἐπ is
here followed by pectus in the accusative: ‘I have raised discussions
and adduced proofs which might penetrate into my breast' To say,
with Lambinus, that in pectus is put for in pectore “ antiquo more‚'’ is
little hettei than an attempt to conceal ignorance. Observe that in
the following line we have in corde not in cor,· after the discussions,
reasonings‚ and proofs had made their way into his breast, he then
turned them over and arranged them “in corde.’' In o. 9, Ei rei
argumenta daiam means, ι111111 adduce proofs of what 1 assert,' and
so uo. 15, 37‚while in v. 9 we have the same meaning expressed by ad
with the accusative, Amalune argumenta dum dieo ad hanc rem. In
Trin. ΙΙ. iv. 121We find nearly the same words, Ei rei argumentum
dz'cam, which there signify‚ ‘1 will prove to you that you ought to
follow my advice ;’ and in Truc. Ι. ii. 68, Amator similis est oppidi
hostilii. D. Quo argumento est t ‘How do you make that outl’ ‘How
do you prove thatl' The transition is easy from a diicussron to the
