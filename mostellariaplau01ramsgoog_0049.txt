10111 PROLEGOMENA.

Diphtlmrgs.

Considerable uncertainty prevailed in the use of diphthongs.
Originally ai seems to have been used in preference to ae. Thus,
GNAIVOD, thILIS [1], AIDlLES‚ AIDILIS, AIDE(M) [3],
QVAIRATIS [5], Qvnlsoer) [6], AlD. CVR. [7]‚ AEDEM,
AlQVOM‚ TABELAI DATAI (nont.) [10]. So PRAIDAD, 1. 63,
643 QVAISTORES, 1. 181, 185 (also QVEISTORES, n. 183);
AIRE, n. 181. So in many proper names, especially in AIMILIVS.

Again, we have oi used for oe: as FOIDERATEI [10]‚ and
FOIDERE [20].

Less frequent is the use of a simple vowel for a diphthong‚ as
FORTVNE, n. 643 FRVDE [12], which may be 11 occidental
blunder, since we have FRAVDE a few lines lower down in the
same inscription

EIS sor IS t'n Dah'ves and ablatus Plura! of the
Ft'rst and Second Declensions.

The practice in this case was similar to what took place in the use
of ei for long i. ln all probability the longer form was universal at first,
prevailed for a considerable time, 111 by degrees fell altogether into
disuse. It maintained its ground however more lirmly and fora
longer period than ei. All the examples in the earliest inscriptions
uniformly exhibit eis. Thus FacTsslls) [4], MIEIS [7], EEIS
three times, and VOBEIS [10], PROXSVMEIS [11 10], ΤΑΒΟ-
LEIS [11 bis], ElS [11]. When we come down to 12 we find the first
indications of uncertainty; although the examples of eis are nume·
rous, we lind ROSTREIS and ROSTRIS, AESTVMANDEIS and
AESTVMANDIs LEGVNDEIS 111 LEGVNDIS‚ and the com·
bination TABOLEIS PVPLICIS‚ although TABOLEIS POPLI-
CEIS occurs 1110. We have three examples 01 PRIMIS in 12,
in 10 three examples 01 PRllleIS, and, generally speaking, down to
20, 111 even later, the form eis will be found greatly to preponderate,
10 that we may without scruple employ it in the text of Plautus*
