lxxii PROLEGOMENA.

Mustela murem ΙΙ apstule't praeter pedes,·

so all the MSS„ including Α.
3. The Hepthems'eseral Caesura in lambio Trinu Hiatus is less

common in this than in the Penthemimeral, but is by no means rare.

Most. 1. 'u 38,
Dique anesus padani: oboluisti ΙΙ allium.

Meu 111. i'u 11,
Prande', palam} scortum acaehui, ΙΙ apstuli.

Sometimes we find a hiatus both in the Penth. and the Hepth. in

the same line, eg„ Most. Ι. i. ιο,
Corrumpe herilem ΙΙ ahdescenem ΙΙ puerum,

where Pylades foisted in pileum, and Ritschl nastrum after herilem, ln
order to bolster up the metre. Rud. III. vl. ιι,
Ego hunc scelestum ΙΙ in ius rapiam ΙΙ exulem.

So also Mers. IV. iv. ι 5,
Videre, amplecti ΙΙ osmlari ΙΙ adloqw‘,
where, il it were worth while, we might avoid the hiatus by writing

amplectier and osculerier.
We find in Trln. 11. iv. 138,139, two lines ln succession which

appear iu all the best MSS. under the form-

Nam fulguritae sunl alternae ΙΙ arbores
Sues morerentur angina ΙΙ acerrume.

In the former Camer. inserts hic alter meet, and is followed by W„
while R. foists in iba· in the second, Hermann has hic aster angeha,

R. has illi, Lind. transposes and reads-
Sues angehea mersantur acerruma,

leaving the last syllable in munientur long, and in his prelace quotes

this as an example of this peculiar prosody.
4. Whereuer there is a thaha pause in the sense. Eveu virgil

thought himself justified in writing, Ecl. 11. 53,
Addam cerea praem ΙΙ honos erit huic quaque ρυηιο.
Et uera s'ncessu paluel Dea. ΙΙ Ille uh· matrem.

Thus Capt. III. iii. 17,
Nugas e'rseph'asque s'acepsa. 11- Haerea.
Ciss II. iii.12‚
Age, perge, quaese: ΙΙ amhnus audere expetit.
5. Α fortiori when there isa transeh'on in the ms‘ddle ‘ff a verse from
one speaker ta another: thus Mero. 1. ii. 74,
C. Qus'palue’l vs'derei ΙΙ Α. Oculis. C. Qua pacta? ΙΙ Α. irrueretur,-
