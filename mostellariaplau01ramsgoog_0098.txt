METRE AND PROSODY. lxxix

saw this difficulty very clearly* and was obliged to have recourse to'
the strange and gratuitous hypothesis that this rule, with regard to the
accentuation of the last syllable, was enforced in the second dipode
of an Iambic Trimeter, but might be freely neglected in the first and
third dipode‚ but he is obliged to admit that even these limits, wide
as they are, will not embrace every case, and that examples occur,
even in the second dipode of a Senarian, where the last syllable oi
apolysyllable must receive the Ictus.

To show that we are not misrepresenting the views ol this great
but rash scholar, we give his very words :-

“ Totum autem hoc, quod de Ictu in ultimis syllabis cantum luisse
diximus, de secrrnda tannim Trimetri διποδίᾳ capiendum·; nam in
prima et tertia semper licnit; siquidem ista sine venia conclamatum
actumque erat de Comoedia Tragoednqne Latina. Cum igitur hunc
versum similesque apud nostrum videris,

Malam quod isti di deaeque οπιηίε dreini,

cave vitio id poetae verteris3 etsi Malum illud et Omnes si in
communi quis sermone sic acuisset, deridiculo suisset. Nimirum
aures vel invitae patienter id ferebant, sine quo ne una quidem
in sabula scaena poterat edolari * * * * In secunda igitur
Trimetri brolia hoc dequo agimus non licebat * * * *
Rarissime igitur, semel atque iterum, sed magno sententiae lucro,
admisit hoc in TrimetrIs Terentius;

Persuasit nox amor mbram, adolescentia

Scelesta avem lupo camenae, deipudet
Nam illud

Nosse omma baec salus est adolescentibus

in hac editione Salute εει,η

Hence we lind, in every page, solo, daturam, aeta, lamani,
corrumpi, commutaturum, or the like. It must he understood there-
sore that these marks, which distinguish Bentley's edition, and which
have been adopted by several recent editors of Plautus and Terence, .

* lndeed, he himself quotes the leading passages from the ancient
grammarians in which it is laid down, as a positive law, that in poly-
syllables the ultimate and antepenultimate alone admit the acute
accent-“ lllu sane in lingua Latina notabile, ne unum quidem verbum
praeter Monosyllaba tonum in ultima habuisse. Deum igitur, Vtram mm
raam priore licet brevi pronuntiabant, numquam nisi in Versu Mar,
Wram, Meam, ‘Taam” ltistobe observed tbat in not one oi the passages
{efeneurlldto by Bentley is there the slightsst indication ol the limitation
ewo insist upon.
