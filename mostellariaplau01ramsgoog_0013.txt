vi PREFACE.

there was much that was perplexing and that could only have
been explained by the writer himself. Hardly any part of the
work was absolutely eomplete3 I could not tell what portions
had been finally revised, or at what period the different portions
had been written3 and in some particulars, trifling in them-
selves no doubt,I found just so much inconsistency as would
spring from a gradual ripening of opinion, and would seem

in others 1 have had to supply the connection. Where it has
been necessary to fill up a gap in the sense, or to indicate
more fully the line of an argument, I have enclosed my own
additions within brackets. And as there are some points, as
to which, not having enough to guide me as to the author's
