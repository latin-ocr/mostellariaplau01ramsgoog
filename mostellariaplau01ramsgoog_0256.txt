and still stronger, Trin. V. ii. 53, L. Sah‘nr salvet dr'c mihi. C. Recte.
‘Is all well? speak. C. All right! 2. Delight, wonder, perplexity3
Poen. 1V. ιι. 97, Saline, proies quom unum est rhr‘ectum telum, tura r'rrsiat
aarum, ie, ‘is it not famous to see that before one dart has been
fairly launched a second follows close upon its heelsl' In the two
following examples astonishment and perplexity are indicated. Trin.
lv. iii 63, Mare, terro, caelum, Di nostram fidem, Satin ego oculr's
plone vilico? estne ipsus, on rrorr esti Merc. IV. i. 16, Sah'n tu sorra es,
opsecro? In Truc. 11. vit a, Satr'rre qui amai nequr'r quin nihili sit Atque
r‘rrrprobis se artr'bro expolrht? the meaning is, ‘is it not strange that
aman in love cannot avoid beinggood for nothing l' Here, and in
many other passages, W considers that satin and satin est are equi·
valent to nonne, hutthe full force of satin would in this ease be quite
lost 3. Wrath and indignation, mingled with surprise, real or
affected—this is the force of sah'rr in the line of our text, Satin abrit,
neque qood dori, flocci rxr'slurnotr‘ i. e. ‘is it possible that he has gone
off ι’ &c.; and so ln Mil. H. vi. 1, which is exacdy parallel, Satin
abrit ille, nequo hrrrle piar negotiata Curat, quara ri non servr'tutem
servilii? so also Pseud. V. ii. 19, Satin ultro et orgarium erasm et me
r'rrrlieti Io Trin. IV. iii. 6, soleii implies seli-reproaeh. Cf. Men.
V. v. 42, Cist 1. iii. 2. We now pass on to the combination satin ut,
with respect to which we must distinguish two cases-(a) when satin
ut is followed by the indicative ; (b) when sanir ut is followedby the
subjunctive. (a) When sairir ut is followedby the indicative it is
equivalent to nonne ariirs ul, i. e, ‘mark how,’ as in Pers. IV. iv, roo,
Satin ut memr‘rrit libertati? Dabit haec tibi grandes bolos, and may,
according to circumstances, indicate adndrahon or contempt or sur·
prise. It indicates admiration in Stich. 1. iii. 114, Scri eccum Dr'nacrirm
eriis porrum! Hoc vriie! Satin ut facete atquc ex patara adstitit?
contempt, in Men. Ι. ιι. 67, Mane, ιιιαιιι, opsecro, hercle: ab se, ecco,
exit. Aa! solem ιιιὶιιι. Sotiis ut occaecatus cst, prae iuriis corporis
ranimiro! smprise, Mero. 11. iv. 13, E. Tute heri ipseo milri rrar-
rasti. C. Satin ut oblr'tussui Tibi me narravisse? ι. e. ‘is it not won-
derful howl forgot that' etc.; surprise and pleasure in Mil. IV. iii 41·
There is a slight difference in the combination of the following
passage, where ut is followed by ria, Men. III. ii. 56, Quid hoc negoti
esre Satin ui qumque correptior Ita rne ludificant? ‘What does this
mean? Is it not possible for me to see any one without being
' mocked by himl’ (b) When sah'rr ut is followed by the subjunctive,
as in Bac. 111. ιιι. 87, Soh‘rr ui quem tu habeas fidelem tihi, aar quoi
credas, nescitis? i. e. ‘is it to be endured that,’ ‘is it not abominable
