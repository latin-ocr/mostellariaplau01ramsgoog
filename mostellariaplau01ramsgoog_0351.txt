208 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

Ouid tute terrore? ‘what’s that you're muttering to yourselfi' Tranio
starts and repfies in confusion, Nihil, ‘O nothing, Ι was speaking
for. . .’ and then breaks off abruptly in order, before committing
himself, to ascertain exactly what Theuropides had heard from the

seller. The broken sentences are amark oi confusion and em· t

barrassment χ
On the same principle we explain Cas. II. vi. 11. The sordb‘o

which is to decide the fate of Casina is about to take place in the '
presence of Stalino and his wife Cleostrata Stalino who, for his own ¹

ends, is eager on behalf of Olympio, says, S. Adpone hic refellam, =

sortes cedo melei: animum advortite Aeque ego censui aps te posse doc me
inpetrare, uxor meo, Caseieo uf uxor madidaretur, el nune etr'am censeo.
C. Tibi daretur ella! S. Mihi enam—oh! e'd non volui dz'cere, Dum
me'frr' uolui frue'c dixi : atque adeo dum mitri cupioperperam Iamdudrm
hercle subtiler. C. Pol tu quidem: atqve etalem siai. Staliuo is so
eager and agitated that he becomes thoroughfy confused, and un·
awares discfoses the real state of his feelings. He begins by saying,
‘I thought, my dear wife, that I might have obtained from you this
favour, that Casina should be made over as awife to-,' and then
mihi slips out instead of Olympioni. On this Cleostrata very naturally
exclaims in wonder, ‘She given to youl' Stalino, carried away by
his exciamem, does not at first perceive his blunder, and continues,
‘ yes, to me, for-,’ and then, becoming aware of what he had said,
interrupte himself, ‘no, no, Ι did not mean to say that,’ and then, in
his terror, he gets hopelessly involved, and plunges deeper and deeper
at every step. We ought therefore to punctuate, C. Tr'di deretur
ailo! S. Mihi, enain-ah! id non volui dicere, Dum me'fei volui frue'c
dixi, atque odeo dvm mr'lri cupro—perperam Iamdudum, hercle, fabuler,
dec, making another abrupt stop after cupe'o, where Stalino becomes
sensible that he is still floundering, and endeavours to get out by
adding, ‘by Hercules, I have been talking nonsense for some time?
To this Cleostrata dryly assents, ‘yes‚ you have been and you are
still talking nonsense!

III. Quia enain. The combination Quia enain seems to be represented
correctly by the idiomatic English phrase‘for why,’ signifying‘because3'
Cas. ΙΙ. νὶ. 33, C. Quid fu id curas? O. Quoia eneae metuo ne in aqua
summo neten· Amph. 11. iii. 34, A. Qui tibi rituc in meedem omri?
S. Quia mein sero adventinum· Mil. IV. ii. 11, Pi„ Ouo argumetum?
