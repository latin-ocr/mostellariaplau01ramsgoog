EXCVRSVS XL-PROBVS, PROBE. 231

that the person spoken of is merely ‘good of his kind ;' as Poen. V.
iii. 6, Praesli'gi'atar bic quidem Poenas probus est, ‘this Carthaginien
is a capital juggler3' and Most 1. iii. 86, Oli probus bomo cum, Quae
pro mc eausam dieerctpalronum liberavi, ⁴1 am a knowing fellow!

Probus, when applied to inanimate objecta, denotes that they are
‘good of their kind ε’ thus Most 111. ii. 41, Vi‘nu ci abac pi'seatii praba
electili,· and Ruit HL v. 19, D. I dum Turbalib, curri’cide adfer tiae
joras Duas clavas. L. Clamas? D. Sed probas, ‘but see that they
are good (stout) ones!

Probe, the adverb, is applied to any act or work performed in a
satisfactory manner: Most. I. ii. 19 (18), Factae (sc. aedes) probe,
examiessim, ie. 'well3constructed 3¹ so Men. ΠΙ. ii. 1, Potsii ut
quiescas, siege tibi banc (sc pallam) toda probe Lepidique mnmmnatam
ederam temperi? again, As. IV. i. 10, scribas aide plane et probe,
‘see that you write it distinctly and conecilyi and Most. 111. ii. 47,
Nos prosecta probe, iit valuimias, aiminus, ‘we have lived well,’ that is,
‘lived apleasant life ;’ aad in the same play, 1. iv. ap, Probe puin amabo
accubas, Delpbiiim mea, ‘place yoorself comfortably-at your ease!

There is however a modificetion of the meaning of prebe which
deserves especial notice, since it occurs very frequently in the
dramatists. It is employed to denote that an aetion has been or
will be performed completely and iri tbe best manner, while the aetion
itself may or may not be praiseworthy, and in this sense the force
oi the word may frequently be correctly conveyed by the English
‘thoroughlyc' thus Amph. 111. iii. ao, Qui me Amphitruonem rentur
esse, errant probe, ‘are thoroughly or completely mistaken3' so Trin.
ΠΙ. iii 88, Eumque liuc ael adulescentem medilatan probe biellam,
‘thoroughly schooled 3' again, Most. 1. i 4, Ego pol te ruri, si eiham,
ulciscar probe ; and V. i 19 (ii. 4), &amics ego bic ludificabo carium, si
ocho, probe; and Bac. 111. iii. 94, Adfatim est, Mnesiloche, cura et con·
castiga bominem probe; and cas. Ι. 36, Ita tc adgerumla curvom aqua
jaciam probe, Vi postilena possit cx te yferi‘, ‘I will render yon so
thoroughly croolred that a saddle-tree (frame of s paclrsaddle) may
be made out of you;' so Bac IV. iv. 50, Ennoigam bominem probe
boae, ‘I vvill befool3' Most V. i. 59 (ii. 44), probe me munxn‘,·
Trirs. IV. ii. 51, ludam bominem probe; Amph 111. iv. 14, aa, saxo
peabc iam lici· deludetur,· and in the passage referred to from Capi.
11. ii. 19, usque admab'labit probe.

Plautus uses also the form adprobe in Trin ΠΙ. ii. 115, Mi'lii can·
crederet, ni'si me ille et ego illum nossem adpram, but it seems to bc an
ber. hey. The word is mentioned by Aul. Geli. Vll. 7.
