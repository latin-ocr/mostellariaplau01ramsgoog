NOTES. I. iii. 104—107. 133

quad gestum non erret,· tollendo quad esset, et semper aliquali demendo,
mutanda, interpolanda. ln the passage before us ruterpalare may be
translated ‘you seek to beautify a most charming work of art by
daubing it over with (ie. by the addition of) fresh colours.' See also
Pliu H. N. XXXV. 16, i 56, Est iu medicaminibus et Chia terra can-
dicans, effletur erardem, qui Samiae. Vsus ad mulierum maxr'rm cutem .·
rilem et Selinusiae. Lactei caleret est haec et aqua dr'lui celerrrma:
eadem lacte diluta tectoriorum albaria rmterpolantrtr, ie. ‘the white
plaster on walls is renovated' (by the addition of this whitewash).
See also Q. Curt. VI. 2, t 5, speaking of Alexander, Igitur quum
intempestivis conventis dtis pariter noctesque consumeret, satietatem epu-
larum ludis rhterpolabat, i. e. ‘diversified by the introduction of! See
also IV. 6, i 28, where the reading is doubtful. Belou, I. iii 117, we
have the adjective ruterpotes, i. e. ‘painted Jezebels,' a word which
occurs only in this passage and twice in Pliny: H. N. XIX a, ξ 8,
speaking of spartum, so extensively used for cordage, he remarks,
Est qurum eries natura r'nterpolr's, rursusqua quam libeat vetustum uano
miscetur, ie. ‘is susceptible of renovation: i. e. as explained by what
follows ‘the old fibre may be worked up again with new to any
extent without injuring the quality of the product' Again, H. N.
XXIX. 1, ξ 5, speaking of medicine, Mutatur ars quatritie tomus in-
urpoat et ingenritrum Graeciae flatu rmpcllr‘nmr, i.e.' ‘changing its
aspect daily.' Holland thus paraphrases the expression, ‘Thus you
see how often this art from time to time hath been altered, and daily
still it is turned like a garment new dressed,' &c

107. Melinum] sc. pigmentum, a fine white earth, named from
the island of Melos in which it was found. Plin. H. N. XXXV. 6,
§19, lifelr'num candidum et iprum est, optumum iu Melo r'rtsula,· in
Sama quoque nascitur: ro non utuntur pictores propter miratam prirgur'·
tuditem* acuebantur fiodrimt itt iuter saxa uenam scrutanter. It was
used also as a medicine. (Plinio.) The young student must be
careful to distinguish this adjective from another the quantity and
spelling of ulrich are the same, viz. nultum, derived from μῆλον, an
apple or quince.† It isused by Plautus to denote some colour,

*And yet he tells us that melinum was one of ‚the four colours used
exclusively by Apelles, Echion, Melanthius, and Nicomachus, the others
being lamp-black (atramentum), the red of Sinope, and the yellow ochre

(stt) of Athens. Plin. H.N. XXXV. 6, § 3²·

† ln Plin. H.N. XXlll. 6,§ 54, fit et oleum ex 1251,un melinum vaca·
mmm, and iu Xlll. 1, § α, we have melinum denoting a perfume (ungruntum)
particularly valued in Cos3 and lower down he givos the mode iu which it
was compounded by the admixture of various substances with metianum oleum.
