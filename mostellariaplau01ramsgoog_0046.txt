ORTHOGRAPHY. xxvii

In point offset, ns far as we can leern from inscriptions, there
was no method in general use, in the earliest period of Roman
literature, by which the vowels d, ε, ό, when pronounced long, were
distinguished in orthogmphy from the same vowels when pronounced
short We have seen that there is no trace of anything of the kind
in the very oldest inscriptions, end although we find occasionally in
some inscriptions eugraved before the downfnll of the Republic
such forms ss FAATO, MAANIVM, ΝΑΑΤΑΜ, PAASTORES,

“ SEEDES, REF„ and the proper names, MAARCVS, MAAR·

CIVS, STAATIVS, VAARVS, VAARIVS, FEELIX, and a
few others, which are collected in the Index to Mommsen, these
are for the most part solitary examples scattered over a wide
areu

With regard to those words which iu later times were written
with long u, we find the long vowel represented sometimes by the
diphthong οἱ, as ln OINO, PLOIRVME [2], COMOINEM,
OINVORSEI [10], MOINICIPIVM quater, 01Nn [14], ΟΙΤΙ-
LE [15], less frequently by oe, as POENICIO, OETVNTVR
[14]‚ but osten by ou, as ABDOVCIT, LOVCANAM [1]‚ IN·
DOVCERE, INDOVCIMVS, INDOVCEBAMVS [15], IOVBEA·
TIS [10],10stRVNT[1s], IOVSERIT [12], IOVSISET [10],
lovs [tn,14‚1s], 10vDEx [11, 11], 10111100 [11,12, 141,
ADIOVDICARI [14], IOVDICIVM [11, 12], IOVDICATIO
[12], IOVRO [11, 12], CONIOVRASE‚ NOVNDINVM, PLOVS
[10].

ὀη theoder hand,we nave vrnrvrnr [1]‚ 1111111115,
VIRTVTE1[r].

The uncertainty that prevailed in the early part of the seventh
century with regard to such words* is well illustreted by the Tables
of the Iex Servilia, in which we find lOVS, IOVDEX, IOVDICES,
IOVDICIVM, IOVDICIO, IOVDICATO‚ IOVDICET‚ IOVDI-
CMTA), IOVDICANDAM, intermingled freely with IVDEX,
IVDICEI, IVDICEM, IVDlCES, IVDICVM, IVDICIBVS,

⁴¹ Great uncertainty prevails also in the inscriptions anterior to the
death of Caesar, with regard to the orthography of the perfect tense of
the verb CVRO. Not onl do we find CVRAVERVNT, CVRAVERE,
but more frequently collenvm COIRAVERVNT, COIRARVNT,
COIRAVERE or COERAVIT, coERnRVNT, COERAVERINT‚
connumerem tn one instance, connvsnonr (n. ⁶s); anu tn one,
QrRAVERvNT (n. 14²8)· ln fact, in inscriptions commemorating the
erectiori of some monument, the ex ression F ACIVNDVM COIRAVIT
(AVERVNT) or COERAVIT (AVERVNT) seem to have been the
established forms.
