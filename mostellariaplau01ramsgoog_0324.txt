EXCVRSVS l.-ADEO. 181

5. Again, adeo ret, like eo ut, frequently refers to an object kept in
view, a design, a purpose: Rud V. iii. 31, dandum huc argentum est
probum, Id ego continuo huri dubo, adeo me ut hic melta! manu, i. e.
‘with the intent that ς’ Stich V. iv. 15, Atque adeo ut tu scire positi,
firclum ego tecum debello, ‘and with the intent that you may be able to
trust in my sincerity,’ bc.; Aul. Ill. ii. 27, Adeo ut tre nuum sementiam
eom eiam noscere possr's, ie. ‘to the intent that you may be able to
become acquainted forthwith with my views‚’ dre.; IV. x. 8, Fateor
peccavisse, et me cupiant commeritum scete, Id adeo te oratum advento
ut omino aequo ignescas milri. The combination here is somewhat
more complicated, but this may be designed to express the confusion
and agitation ot' the speaker3 the general meaning is, ‘I have come
with the intention of entreating your forgiveness!

Ill. Adeo equivalent to eo modo, ea rubine, is used for the most part
with an explanatory force, ‘in that way,' ‘thus’ ‘such being the
case,' ‘therefore’ ‘then’

When adeo is translated by ‘therefore’ or by ‘then,' the former ot'
these is not to be regarded as necessarily denoting a stn'ct logical
deductim, nor the latter as denoting with emphasis a particular point
ol time, but both are used like the Greek οὖν to indicate a sequence
ol events, or the continuation of an action oros a narrative, as when
we say, ‘alter many dangers therefore Hannibal descended from the
Alps into the plains ol ltaly‚' ‘let reason then at her own quarry fly,'
‘we first leave childhood behind us, then youth, then the years ol
ripened manhood, then' dre. There is properly au adverb of place,
then of time, but they are not unfrequently regarded as equivalent.
Thus in the Gospel ot St. John, cap. ii. 18, the words ἀπεκρίθησαν
οὖν ol Ἰουδαῖοι are translated iu our authorized version, ‘then answered
the jews and said unto him,’ but in Wicliffe’s Bible‚ ‘therfor the
Jewis answerden and seiden to him ;’ and this brings us round to
what may be regarded as the original etymological meaning ol adeo,
viz. adea, praeterea, ‘besides' ‘moreover’

The meanings oi adeo which belong to head 111. must be
illustrated by several examples‚ for they have in many cases em·
barrassed lexicographers and commentators, and have led to useless
complicatious, or, not seld0m‚ to the despairing remark, “adeo
abundat‚’' i. e. ‘means nothing :¹ Epid. V.ii 38, P. Dediie tr'bimr'nas
tregtieta ob filebmr‘ E. Fateor dolas, Ee eo argmlo illam me eme'sse
ame'cam fili fidicinam, Pro tua filzia: istis adeo te tete'gi tre'ge'nla meiee's,
‘in that way,' ‘thus,’ eo (leuc) moda· As. II. iii. aa, Libanus having

given a minute description ol the personal appearance ol Saurea, the
