Volo temperi: audi: henr, tibi imperatum est.
Nam i11i‚ubi fui, inde effugi foras: Ι

Nunc commissatum ibo ad Philolachetem,

Vbi nos hilari ingenio et lepide accipiet.
Ecquid tibi videor, mama-madere?

ln the following Scene, more than the usml amount of confusion exista

in the different MSS. and edd. in regard to the distribution of the dialogne
among the characters. We have, for the most part, adhered to the
Vulgate. Hermann, Ritschl, and Weise, differ as to the metrica] consti·
tution of the passage, and each introduces changes in order to suit his
own views. We have closely followed the division into lines found in B,
except in one instance, and have adhered to the text of that MS, except
where it was obviously corrupt.
