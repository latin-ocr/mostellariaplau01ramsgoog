, . Mirum quem te advorsus artae, i. e. ‘it is very likely that he (your own
slave) will contradict youl'* Aul. 1. ιι. 7, Mirum quem ma nuuc mc
causasaciat Iuppiter Philippum regem aut Darium, treberufical i. e. ‘it
is very likely, is it not, that Iupiter, lor your sake, will make us rich
as king Philip or Dariusl' Cist. IV. ii. 67, Halisca, when inquiring
sor the cistella which she had lost, says Nou edepol pracda magua, ‘it
would be no great prize to any one who has found is,' to which
Lampadiscus replies, Mirum quem grex uenalium iu cistella eusuerit
una, ι. e. ‘it is very likely, is it not, that there should be a troop οι
slaves (or anything else of value) in that box of yours ιι Merc. Ι. 91,

ιιι. 373 Trin. IV. ιι. ¹²5· There is a passage in Pers. III. ιιι. 37, in
which mirum is followed by quem, but they are disconnected by a long
stop, and hence the meaning is different3 T. Fortasse metues iu mamm
concredere. D. Mirum: quin cattus eam α soro argmtart'i Abeunt, quum
iu cursu rotula circumvertitur, ie. ‘you are perhaps afraid to trust

mean literally, ‘I shall be surprised ιι so and so is not the case‚' but
generally may be correctly expressed by our ‘l shouldn't wonder ιι so
and so is the case ;' thus Amph. 1. i. 163, Mirum ui Ιιῖν me quasi
muraenam exossare cogitat, ‘l shall be surprised if this fellow is not
thinking οι boning me as ιι 1 were amuraena,’ ie. ‘I believe that

Mira suut nisi latuit emtus illic iu illac heruca, i. e. ‘I shouldn't be
surprised if that fellow was lying concealed in that wine jar ς’ Bac. 13¹1.
iii. 46, Μῖνα suut mi Peltoclcrus Lucium pugnes contudit, ⁶1 shouldn't
