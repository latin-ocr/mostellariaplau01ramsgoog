lt will be readily inserted, from what has been already stated, that
the constitution of the teatin the twelve last plays of Plautus de·
pends entirely on B, C, D, together with such aid as we occasionally
derive from A, whose authority, when distinctly available, is almost
paramount The readings of F are carious, as in thein we traca
the process by which so many of the Latin classica became corrupted
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while Z, the value of which
has frequently been greatly overestimated, must be regarded as an
attempt to return more nearly to the genuine tert by rejecting several
of the more flagrant interpolations.

Moreover, there is such a close general resemblance between
B, C, D, that it is evident that they belong to one family ; that is to
say, that they were all three derived from the same archetype without
passing through many intermediate stages; but it is certain that no
one of these three was copied from either of the two others, although,
as noticed above, the connection between C and D is more close
than that between B and either of them.

B, C, D, have all been frequently collated since the time of Came·
rarius, and it may be proper to notice the manner in which they
have been variously designated

B andC are generally distinguished, since the time of Parcus, as
Cod. Vel. and Cod. Decurt, and, when spoken of jointly, as the
Codd. Palati.

Until the time of Ritschl, D was not sharply distinguished from
the three other MSS. in the Vatican (which he calls G, H, K), all of
which were written in the fifteenth century, and all belong to the
interpolated family, and as such are oi little or no value, the whole
being frequently referred to vaguely as Codd. Vatr'c.
