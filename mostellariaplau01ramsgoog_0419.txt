‘il I do not send γοιι about your business alter I have made you cut
amiserable figure! In Pseud. 1. iii. 135 we have the phrase, to he
noticed again below, mam ludere, ‘to lose one's labour‚' In putaram
tingeremus dicta dalricm, operam ladiman- and this in Rud. IV. ig
appears under the lorm, Nam marc ct operam ludarsacr't* et retra, ‘he
is losing his lebour and spoiling his nets'

We must carelully distinguish the phrase ludos facere anguem, ‘to

make a show oi a person‚' lrom ludas facere alisii which properly ,
signifies ‘to exhiblt games in honour ol one deceased: and isused ’
ογ Plautus in the ironical sense, ‘to exhibit a spectacla lor the ι

amusement of others in honour ol a living man, who is as powerless
in the hands of the exhibitors as ii he were a corpse on the nmen
pyre.’ The origin ol the expression is nearly indicated in Most ss.
i. 80, Ladas ego hadri nmo praesenti lm'c sem· Faciam, quad credo mortua
numquam sare, ‘I will exhibit games in honour ol this old gentleman
alive and loolr'ing on-a distinction which, I fancy, will never be
accorded to him when dead3' so Cas. IV. i. 1, Nec pol ego Nemea
credo, neque ego Olumpraa Neque usquam ludar tam sesh‘vos fieri, Qmm
tic etatae fiunt ludi ludificabiles Sem’ nostro, al nostro Olumpmnivstica· ἵ
and so Truc. lV. ii. 46, where Dinarchus erclaims, Iam hercle ega tim, ¹

inlecebra, ludar semitm, clamore im vra, he does not mean, ‘I will make ⁴

game ol y0u‚’ or ‘I will make alool ol y0u‚' but says ironically, ‘l
will make an exhibition in honour ol you by shoutiug out your name
in the public street,’ referring to the papulam, which is fully explained
in the note on Most. 111. i. 59 (55).

We find the following couplet twice in Plautus, Merc. 11. i. 1 and ι
Rud. ΙΙΙ. i. r, Μίνίι modis Di ludar factitat hamrm'bus, lllr'rirgue '
exemplis samnia in sommi danuam. We must not suppose that the ι
speaker intends to say, ‘the Gods make sport of men‚' that is, ι

‘belool or deceive or hold them up to ridicule,' which would ογ ιιο

means accord nith the belief then prevalent with regard to dreams,
but, ‘altera marvellous lashion do the Gods exlubit spectacles sor
men,’ that is, ‘for the interest and instruction osmeri, ογ warning

them ol coming events by strange appearances exhibited ιο them in '

dreams.' Observa that the lorms used ογ Plautus are invariably
ludos facere aliquam or 'ludas sacae alicui, never ludam, the phrases
being derived from Iudi in the sense ol Public Spectacles; the only

* Here the MSS. have ludos dat, but Priscian in quoting the passage
gives ludos facit.

tRitschl, Parerg. Plaut. l. p. 427-3o‚ seems to regard them as sy-
nonymous.
