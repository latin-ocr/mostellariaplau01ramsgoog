here give ut, which the verse requires, and notatur of the Vulg. tent:
the meaning will be ‘however (bad) the condition of my own affairs 33
but Bentley renders it, ‘I rejoice in so far as the condition of my
own affairs permits me to rejoice.' The combination utu! occurs
several times in Plautus, where the reading is not doubtful, e. g. Most.

X.—FR VGI, NEQ VAM.

That frugi is frequently used as an indeclinable adjective by
writers of all epochs is unquestionable, and it is equally certain that
it is the dative case of frux, frugri. ln Plautus it is frequently
coustrued with sum, and may in that case be regarded asa real
dative: As. ΙΙ. iv. 91, quamquam agarum sardriiatm, Frugi tamen sum ,·
Pers. IV. i. 5, Simulus aut nequam est, male res vortunt quas agiu Sin
auum frugi est, cucurum frugaliter, and as if to marlr the word more
distinctly as a substantive the epithet bonae is often added ; Pseud. 1.
v. 53, Cupis nuesse nequam, tanum ero frugi banaa· As. 111. iii. 12,
Numquam bonae frugi crau, dus nucusque pauni, while the accusative
frugem is occasionally found in the sarne sense 3 thus Trin. Ι. ii. 81,
Quin ad frugem canrigr‘sr' II. i. 34, Certum es! ad frugem adplr'care
amrinum· Poen. IV. ii. 70, Herm sr' tuus ualet facere frugem· but in

many instances it rnr'rst be regarded as indeclinable‚ as may be v

observed in some of the examples given below.

The true meaning of frugi is clearly indicated by the etymology-
it is used to denote that a person is ‘profitable' or ‘useful' either
to himself or to others. Thus it assumes many modifications of
meaning*

r. When used with reference to one who is profitable to himself
it may signify ‘economical’ or ‘thrifty' as in the following lines,
where it is opposed to brugnus: Truc. Ἰ. i. 13, Tema denegatum an

bunuesrugr suu· u. uo, si id quad aralur deaei, Atque est benegnus poam
quam frugi bonae: or ‘prudent' Capt. II. ii. 44, Phr'lacrates hic fecit
hominem fregi u! facere aperturi: or ‘respectable’ Cure. IV. ii. 16,
Nec uobuicum quisquam in saro frugi emutilare auden and so Atvl. lv,
ix. 6, Quid est? quid ridetis? navi amnes .· scr'o sures esse lu'c complures
