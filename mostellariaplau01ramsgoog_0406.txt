crem pedicis* condideritis sic lure grassari gradu. There seems to be
a distinction drawn, in Men. 1. i. 3, between catenae and compedes,
the former being a more general term: Homines eaptehos qut catem'e
munient, Et qur'sugr'tr'vr‘s serur's r'rrdunt conpedes· cs. vv. 8, 9, 10.

Catellus is also used by Plautus as a diminutive os catenans well
as a diminutive of eatulw Cure. V. iii 13, where Phaedromus is
addressing the leno Cappadox, Delicatum te hodr'e sacram eune catello
ut accubet, Ferrea ego dr'eo. Catellus in the sense of ‘a puppy,' Stich.
IV. ii. 403 and catellum, As. 111. iii. 103.

The works of Plautus and Terence, os the former especially, are
full of words and phrases applied as taunts to those who had under·
gone the punishments above described3 some of these recur per-
petually, others seem to have been coined on the spot as it were,
and are de. λιγ. Such ere Verber0,Mastegri1,Flngitriba, Pluge'pate'da,

times two wranglers reciprocate a series of such compliments: As. ΙΙ.

Since the plot in most of the specimens ol the New Comedy,
which have been transmitted to us through the medium oi the Latin
dramatists, tums upon some trick or mystification, played off gene-
rally by a crafty slave, we might anticipate that tbe vocabulary of
Plautus and Terence would be well stored with words and expres·
siuns denoting roguery.

Accordingly, we shall find the idea ol deception presented to ns
under a great variety os different forms, many of thern highly
ingenious, lively and amusing.
