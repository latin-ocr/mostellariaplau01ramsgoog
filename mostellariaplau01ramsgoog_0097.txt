lxxviii PROLEGOMENA

employed in our own ianguage‚ and the corresponding Latin term
Accmtas by several continental writers. ln popular language the
terma Quantrh‘, Accent, and Emplraris, although periectly distinct,
are frequently confounded, but all who employ precise arrd scientific
language understand that Accent applies only to that elevation or
depression ol tone which correspond to what are termed high and
low notes in music. lt is by the proper application of accent that
we prevent reading or recitation from becoming monotonous, but
this has no necessary connection whatever with the quantity ol' a
syllable, which depends solely on the time that the voice dwells
upon it in comparison with other syllables

But while several modern grammarians have vainly imagined that
the quantity oi a syllable might be influenced by the accent, Bentley
introduced fresh complicatione and fell into the strange mistahe oi
coniounding the Acute Accent with* the Ictus Metrius, which has by
some writers been most unfortunately termed the Metrr'cal Accent.
This phrase, Ictus Metrr'cvcr, it is now universally admitted, was em·
ployed by grammarians to denote the stress which must be laid upon
certain syllables in repeating verse in order that the rhythm ol the
measure may be made perceptible to the ear. ln Dactylic verse
theletus falls upon the first syllable of the Dactyl andos the Spondee3
in Iambic verse, on the long syllable oi the Iambus and the second
syllable oi the Spondee3 in Trochaic verse, on the long syllable oi
the Trochee and the first syllable oi the Spondee. When feet are
resolved‚ the lctus maintains its place, and hence in Iambic verse the
Ictus falls on the second syllable of the Tribrach‚ the second syllable
os the Dactyl‚ and the last syllable oi the Anapaest ς in Trochaic verse,
on the first syllable of the Tribrach, the Dactyl, and the Anapaeat
That the Ictus Metricus has not in itself any connection with quantity
is evident from what has been stated above, that it falls according to
the verse, sometimes upon the first and sometimes on the second
syllable of the Spondee, on the first or second oi the Dactyl‚ and on
the first or second of the Tribrach. Os the two syllables oi the
Spondee, which are, in so iar as quantity is concemed, equally long,
the first receives theletus in Dactylic verse, and the second in lambio
verse, while one oi the short syllables oi the Dactyl has theletus in
Iambics, and one of the short syllables os the Anapaest in Trochaics.
That it has no connection with the Acute Accent or Accent proper
is equally evident from the fact that in polysyllables the Acute Accent
can sall only on tlte penultimate or antepenultimate, while in innu-

merable instantes the Ictus must sall upon the last syllable. . Bentley
