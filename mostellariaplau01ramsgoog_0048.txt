ORTHOGRAPHY. xxix

fura· mendaces} perhaps to distinguish it from the ablative mendaci*
There is no reason to suppose that the proposals of Lucilius were
ever accepted and recognised in practice; the use of ei for τ’ gra·
dually, although slowly, sell into disuse, and to the last we find no
consistency.

There are however a few words in which, sor along period, ei
was uniformly employed.

Foremost among these is the relative Qui, which, both in the nom.
sing. andnons pl., appears almost invariably as Qua· down to the
beginning of the eighth century.

QVEI in the nom. sing. occurs upwards of two hundred times in
the inscriptions 1-193 Qvi once only, viz. in 13 (B.C. 117). In
20 QVEI occurs about fifty times, QVI twice.

QVEI in the nom. pl. occurs about sixty times in 1-20, QVI once
only, viz. in 13. QVEIQVOMQVE (sing. and pl.) appears first in
11, and in inscriptions u-ao about twenty-six times without variation.
SEI for 81 occurs upwards of seventy times in 1-20 3 81 once only,
via. in 14. QVASEI is found in 11,12,1o‚ in all seven times;
QVANSEL apparently a blunder,† in 14 3 QVASI never. VTEI
appears first in 10, and in the inscriptions 10-20 upwards of ninety
times; VTl occurs five times, commencing with 11. In the in- ι
scriptions lo-ao, IBEI, VBEI, NEI, NEIVE, occur more fre-
quently than lBI, VBI, NE, NEVE, but IBI, NE, NEVE are by
no means uncommon.

CEIVIS seems to have long maintained i'ts ground. It is found
in 10, and in the inscriptions 10—14 CEIVIS and its cases, spelled
with ei in first syllable, occur about fourteen times; CIVES appears
for the first time in 16.‡ CEIVITATE occurs four times in 12.
So in the inscriptions 11-19 DEICO occurs nearly thirty times:
viz. DEICAT three times, DEICERENT once, DEICET eight
times, DEICITO eleven times, DEICVNTO twice, DElCERE
once, DElCEl twice, DEICVNDO once. DICERE, DICITO
appear first in 203 the forms DIXI and DEIXI‚ with their
derivativas, were used indifferently.

*Varro also appears to have attempted to lay down rules upon the
mure subject (Terent. Scaur. l.c.)‚ but the words of Scaurus are very ,
Obicirlgooe not this 'spelling rather afford a truce of the original form
Osssthglll'ifiidfifflusdtpedffdin 14, but there is a fiaw in the tablet at the
commencement of the word.
