Div. 1. 39, § 36, Nema alr'ter philosophus sensti, in quo modo esset
auctoretas, ‘provided only lte were a man of weight' Cicero wishes
to quallfy the expression Nemo philosophus as too comprehensive, and
to lirnit his assertion to those whose names carried auctoritas with
them. Cic. de Senect. Vll. i aa, Manent rigensis scardus, modo per·

Perlexr't, modo non cremer auri polluens, ‘only not promising,' ‘pro-
mising everything short of whole ltills of gold‚’ ‘the only limit to his
