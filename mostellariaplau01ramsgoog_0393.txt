There is another passage inPlautusvrhich maytbrowsome light
upon the subject; in Men. 111. iii. ry Er0tium'a maid says to
Menaechmus, Anah, uri Menaechme, dmoni da mh· ramas
mado darm naman, smegma, ‘plesse Menaechmus dear, gire the
jeveller (gold) to the weight os two numi to make for me a pair of
dropearrings! ls ve suppose that a mar weighed two drachmae,
he. about ¹3² or ¹33 Troy grains, thequantity here asked t'or would
be appropriate, but the weight ol a rutena in diver, say six Troy grains
would be greatly too small, and the weight os a auth in oopper
absurdly large.

lt will be observed also that the gold Philippus veighed two Attic
Draclmrs,and hence the term mm deuotingllidrachmwas natu·
rally applied to each, the epithet aurem being employed to distinguisb
the golden Didrachm from the silver Didrachm.

There is still another consideration which, although hypothetioal,
'may possibly bear upon this question. No* attempt to ooin silver
was made at Rome until 269 B.C. When we consider the stormy
and critical character ol her history sor nearly a cenmry aster that
date, it is not probable that the mint would be very active until the
spoils ol Macedonia and Asia vere poured into the Treasury. Hence
during the tiseos Plautus the silver currency must hare consisted
chiefly of foreign colus, those iu· circulatiou among the Greeks os
Magna Graecia and Sicily. But, judging from the medals which
have come down to modern times· the Didrachm vas more common
than any other pieee in these regions, and vast numbers have been
preserved belonging to Tarentum, Velia, aud Syracuse. Tbese do
not, in most cases, exactly correspond to the weight of the tute
Didraehm‚ but Plautus might give the name os aurato or nam ar-
genti to the pieces with which be vas most familiar.

We may nov briefly recapitulate the dldment propositions which
we have endeavoured to prove.

r. The Nummos Plautus, when the word is used to designate
a particular coin or specific sum, refers to the Greek monetary
system exclusively.

a. When the epithet aurem is added, or distinctly implied it
denotes the Philemo.

3. When the epithet aureus is not expressed,·and not evidently l
impres, then ne simple amus, sometimes termes m argens, l
invariably represents a Greek Didrachm os silver.
