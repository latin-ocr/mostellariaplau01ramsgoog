generally in ιο accersat, ‘to that war added! So eodem may mean
‘to the same place’ and ‘to the same person!

Since ιο may signify ‘to that place,' the place may, incertain
cases, be regarded as the extreme point or limit of progression, and
hence, when followed by ut, it frequently signifies ‘to that (such a)
point,’ ‘to that (such a) pitch,’ ‘to that (such an) extent,’ ac, as in
the phrases, urbs ιο creuit ut magnrludrire laboret sua, ‘the city has*
increased to that point,' or ‘to such an extent ς’ ιο rem adducam ul,
ac, ‘I will bring the matter to that (such a) point 3' ιο furoris
processit, ‘he advanced to that point (such a pitch) of phrenzy,' dac.

From the idea of moving or travelling towards acertain place or
point, the transitionis easy to the notion of ‘keeping an object in
view! Hence, figuratively, ιο denotes the direction ln which the
thoughts or actions move, and hence ‘a purpose, ‘an intention,' ‘a
design' being in this case followed by quo, ut, ne, qur'rr, or the like.
This is clearly brought out in the expressions—eo scrr'psi quo plus
malorrlalrl haberem-blnda ad te ιο mesi rat-eo lc non *thinpellavr‘
rte-non ιο froc dr'co quin quae tu ur's rgo uelim effaetam lubens. So
codem signifies ‘to the same purpose’ in the phrase ιοάιοι peram “

ΙΙ. Εο signifying ‘by that! When we read in Livy—Nocte at melle·
tantm et peremerant.- ιο melodas bostram fallebant—eo signifies ‘by
that‚’ ‘by that modeof procedure,' ‘by doing that,' and it serves to
explain a previous statement. Hence ιο is frequently equivalent to
‘thus' or doc modo, ‘for this reason? ‘therefore ;’ end when Cicero
says, frater er, eo οινιοι, ιο is explanatory, and means ‘for that
reason,' ‘therefore 3’ and again, dederam triduo ante faleras ad te, eat
erolrcvrbr. So ιο when joined with a comparative signifies‘ ‘ by that?
in the sense of tanto—eo gravrbr est dolor, quo adpo mazar—and so
eo magr's, ιο maara, ‘by that (so much) the more,' ‘by that (so much)
the less!

This being premised with regard to ιο, it will be found, as might
have been expected, that adeo resembles it very closely in meaning,
indeed, in many cases, ιο might be substituted for adeo and vice versa,
without the sense being perceptibly changed. The different meanings
of adeo may be ranged under three heads ¹

l. Adeo equivalent topraeterea, and signifying simply ‘in addition
to that'

11. Adeo signifying ‘up to that point!

ΙΙΙ. Adeo signifying ‘thus' ‘in that way,' ‘therefore'

We shall select some of the most striking examples of the
multifarious meanings ascribed bylFreund and others to adeo, and
