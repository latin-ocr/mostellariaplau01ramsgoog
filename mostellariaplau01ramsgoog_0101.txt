been comprehended by grammarians under the general title ol
Poetical Licences. Without stopping to inquire into the strict pro·
priety ol this term, we should expect that all the ‘licences' lound
in the epic and lyric poets would present themselves in the dre·
matists, and we need feel no surprise il they exceed those ol the
later writers both ln number and boldness.

r. The letterl. Since the character i was employed to denote
both avowel and also a consonant, which, itis probable, had the
sound ol an English y, the Augustan poets permitted themselves
occasionally to give it the force of aconsonant in certain words in
which it properly represented avowel. Thus the words, abrih‘bm,
paruulus, which as quinquesyllsbles, with the first lour short, would
be inadmissible in Dactylic verse, were pronounced and scanned
· as quadrisyllables, adyetr'bur, paruulus, the first syllable being now
made long by position. So also, without the plea of absolute
necessity, we lind fluryrorum, abyegnae, as trisyllables, and such
combinatione as consr'lyfet (for comiltum et), prtum‘pshuc (lor prtit-
cr'ptum huc), and a lew others.
