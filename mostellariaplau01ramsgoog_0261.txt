channel which receives the rain as it drops from the tiles, and carries
it lrom the roof in a single stream. Such seems to be the explana·

tion oi Isidorus XIX. ιο and ol Pliny H. N. XXXV. 12, ξ 43, who, r
when recounting the inventione of Dibutades of Sicyon, says, primusque Ῑ
personas tegularum extremis imbricibus imposuit, although his words ³
are by no means clear. Imbrex occurs again in connection with

tegulae in Mil 11.vi. 24, Quod meas confregisti imbrices et tegulus,· and

in Sisenna Histor. 111, uespera imbribum fragminibus ac testis legu-
larum, quoted by Non. p. 125, s. v. Imbriees ac tegulas. From the ,

curved form oi the imbrex it is used by Virgil in connection with an
arched roob (imbrice teeu', G. lV. 296); in Martial Epp. 11. xxxviia
it denotes some portion of a pig, Mammas suminis imbricemque perci,
but what portion we cannot tell; while from the sound os water
rushing through a narrow charmel it was applied to one os the forms
os theatrical applause executed by bodies of men trained for the
purpose (bembus et embre'ces et testas uocabant), perhaps something
like our Kentr'sb fire. See the very curious passage in Sueton.

negative. Compare ne parcunt=mm parcunt, ne quedem, nedum, and
such words as neglego, negotium, necopinum.

27. Perpluent Tegna] The verb perpluo is used by Plautus in
two ways, transitively and intransitively. Here it is used intransitively:
perplacent tegna, ‘the beams let in the water,' i. e. ‘the water makes
its way into the beams' lu iii. 8 we have it in the transitive sense:
Haec illa est tempestas mea, mibi quae nudertrbm omnem Detexit tetus
qim sui quam mebi Amor et Cupeiie In pectus perpluit meum, ke·

, ‘rained through into my heart ;' and in Trin. Il. ii. 41, Benesacta bene·

scetii aliei· perlegite ne perpluere, i. e. intransitively‚ ‘lest they let the
water through! Perpluit is generally used impersonally, ‘to let rain
or liquid in through a crevice ;' but see Most. IV. i. 16, Malum quem
e'uplm‘t ceteros, reon impluat mebi, and observe the change oi construction.
For other examples of the use of perpluere see Fest. p. 250, ed. Μ.,
“Peterem perplovere in sacris quum dicerent, significabant pertusam
esse,’' i. e. ‘leaka lets out the liquid,' where ue see the ancient sorm
pleuo, whence plreuim (cistae-fluuius) ; Cato R. R. 155, In uella cum
pluet, circumire oportet, semebe' perpluat, et st'grture eurbmn, eum desierat
pluere, uti tegula mutetur, ie. ‘water makes its way in.' Quint VI.
