164 Ριιιιιι Μοειιιιιιιιιι

from this play, the following will serve to illustrate the origin ol these
phrases and the manner in which they are used: Capt 111. iv. reo,
Satin rnc r'llr‘ hodie scelesti copti ceperunt dolo, where there is a sort of
pun ou copti (prisonem) and ceperunt,· so Bac. V. ii. 88, Lepide ipsi
Ιιι· sunt copti, suis qni filiis secere insidens: r'te,· and Pseud. lv. iii. rr,
Metuo ouum, nc herus redeat enirm dunt o soro, Ne capto proedo capti
praedones Ῑιιιιιιι,Ι Epid 111. ii. 23, iarn rjose cantor copher est. Copto
significa ‘to lie in walt for3' Amph. L i. 2⁶6, Qun rne coptos, cor·
nusex) i. e. ‘why are you trying to catch me by your questionsl'
11. ii. 163, Me captas, ‘you are trying to ensnare me ;' and in v. 189,
copto is distinguished from cepo, Tu si rnc r'rnpnde'cr‘trhe coplas, non
potes capere, ie. ‘il you are endeavouring to lead me into a snare,
and convict me of unchsstity, you are not able to entrap me ;' and
in Epid 11. ii 31, eos captabant signifies ‘they were watching to
cusnare them3’ in o. 112, Verum, se' plns dederm reserare .· nihil e'n ea
re capn'o cst. So ceptris est, Truc. Il. vii 65, ‘that is not fair3’ aud
As. IV. i. 45, captiones nutur's, ‘you are afraid oi having tricks
played off uponyou! ⁸

ιγ. Nunc ego me illoc per posticum od congerrones conseram] There
seems to be no doubt that the word congerrones signifies ‘jolly com·
panions,' ‘metes' or something equivaleut. It occurs again below,
V. i. 8, Capio consilium ut sennan congerronum cononem ,· end iu
Pers. 1. iii. 9, Iam pol ille ln‘c ederet, credo, congerro eneces. Nom, p. 1 18,
quotes the line [rom the Persa and explains it, ‘ut conlusor mens qui
easdem exerceat nugas? Gerro is found in Heaut V. iv. ιο, gerro,
iners, fraus, helluo Ganeo, danmorus. Observe also the word gerres
denoting ‘spreta’ or some small, worthless fish. The etymology
is altogether uncertain. Varro, L. L. VII. 55, who also quotes this
line, says, “Congerro a gerra et Graecum est, et in Latina cratis’'
The Greek form¹ with which we are acquainted is γέρῤοι, and signifies
‘anything made of wicker-work,’ thus answering closely to cratis, but
the connection with congerro is by no means obvious. Gerroe is used
several times by Plautus in the sense ol ‘stuli and nonsense,' ‘bosh,’
‘trash;' e. g. Poen. 1. i. 8, Nan tuoe blandinhe ner'lrr' sunt, quod dici
solet, Gerrae germanae, atque edepol λῆροι λήρων ; and so gerrae mox·
nnec, in Epid ΙΙ. ii. 49: frequently it is simply an exclamation, as in
Trin. 111. iii. 31, and As. 111. iii. ιο. The word reappears in Ausonius,
in the preface addressed to Symmachus, prefixed to Eidyll. XI.
Mr‘se' r‘taque ad te srtbola gerris Siculis oonriora, where by the epithet
Sr'cnlrs he evidently allodes to the foolish story told in Paul. Diae.
