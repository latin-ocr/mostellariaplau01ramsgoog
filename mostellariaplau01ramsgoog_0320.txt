EXCVRSVS.

1.-ADEO.

This word, as exhibited in some of our best dictionaries, presents
a somewhat formidable aspect. In that of Freund, for example, what
with classifications and divisions and subdivisione, the meanings are
distributed under seventeen or eighteen heads, and no pains have
been taken to connect them by a common hond. Let us endeavour
to simplily the matter.

It cannot reasonably be doubted that adeo is compounded of ad
and eo. The Roman grammarianS, while admitting this etymology,
were embarrassed by the consideration that ad, a preposition govem·
ing the accusative, should be followed by an ablative eo. Thus Paulus
Diacouus s. v., p. 19, ed Mun, while distinguishing adeo the verb from
adeo the adverb, remarks with regard to the latter--“ idem (significat)
quod usque ιο, non quidem secumdum rationem, quia ad praepositio
accusativis accommodata est, sed vetusta quadam loquendi consuetu·
dine’'-a practice, as Mttller observes, similar to that which prevails in
the words praetcrea, propterea, hucpropter‚ quoad, reliquo,l &c Avoiding
all etymological speculations as to the form ee, but taking it for
granted that adeo is made up of ad and eo, it will be necessary, in the
first place, to examine the meanings of eo. These, although at first
sight various, may all be reduced to two.

1. Eo signifying ‘to that!

11. Eo signifying ‘by that’

1. Eo signifying ‘to that’ is used directly with reference to place
in such phrases as eo se recepere coeperunt, i. e. ‘they began to betake
themselves thither (to that place) ;’ and so co pervertere, eo reuerti, uc.
-it is used with reference to time in eo usque me urbere vultr's donec,· ,
eone usquc dum ea nascantur ad Casilinum cessurus sum-it is used

* See Non. Marc. s. v. adqua p. 76.
