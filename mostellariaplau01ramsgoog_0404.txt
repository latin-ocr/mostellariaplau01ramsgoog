EXCVRSVS XV.-SLA VE PUNISHMENTS. 261

Numella s. Nunallus seems to signify a combination 'ol a collar
sor the neck with stocks sor the feet Similar contrivances were
employed for confining cattle and dogs. See Nonius (144), “Nu-
mellae machinae genus ligneum ad discruciandos noxios paratum,
quo et collum et pedes inmittunt. Plautus Aulularia, nervos, catenas,
carcerem, amellae, pedicas, boras‚'’ where “Amulium'' is a mistalre
sor “Asinaria'' Paul. Diae. p. 172, ed. Mun„ “Nunulla genus
vinculi quo quadrupedes deligantur.'' See also Colum. R. R. VI.
19, Vll. 8.

Boia 'l'hat this was a collar would be proved by a passage in
Prudent. Psychom. Praei. 33, attrita barii calla, il we could depend
upon the text, but the reading isvery doubtful. Plautus has a pun-
ning joke upon the word in Capt. iV. ii. 108, and it will be observed
that in the passage which we are discussing numellas, pedriar, boras
are placed together.

Nervus s. Neruam is explained by Festus, p. 165, ed. Muli:
“Neruam appellamus etiam ferreum vinculum quo pedes inpedi-
untur: quamquam Plautus eo etiam cervices vinciri ait perfidare
captus eo epol nerva cervias prabat.'’ The word occurs again in Aul.
IV. x. ι3, Capt 111. v. 71, Cure. V. iii. 12, 40, 45, Poen. V. iv. 99,
Rud. 111. vi. 34, 38, 51. ln the last there seems to be a direct
reference to the neck: Credo alrirm in altam beluam hominm uartrir,
Illic r‘n columbam, creda, leno vortam, Nam r‘n columbari callum haud
multo post erit, In nervam ille lradr'e nidamenta congeret; where calam·
bare must mean a collar, and is introduced in connection with
columbus in consequence of its resemblance to columbarium. ln
many passages nervus is equivalent to a chain, hence may signily
aprison, and this may be the meaning in the line just quoted. Cl.
Cure. V. iii. 40. In Phor. II. ii. ιο the expression densanturque
amram! verum hoc saepe, Pharaia, Vereor, ne istaecsarliluda in nervam
erumpat denr'quc, seems to be equivalent to our ‘should come to
grief! ln the same play, IV. iv. 15, In nervam patrias ibit probably
means ‘he will go to gaol first! lt would appear that the original
meaning ol neruus or nervum, which is probably identical with the
Greek νεῦρον, was not, as lexicographers insist, ‘a muscle’ or ‘sinew'
or ‘tendam' but ‘a thong or strap made ol hide,' and hence ‘a
cord' or ‘string' the anatomical application being figurative and
secundary. In all the oldest Latin writers it is generally equivalcnt
to uincula, either in the sense of acollar, or of bonds, or ol a place
ol confinement ln the Laws ol the XII. Tables as quoted by
Aul. Gell. XX. 1, with regard to insolvent debtors, the creditor is
