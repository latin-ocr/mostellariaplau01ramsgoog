METRE AND PROSODY. cxi

Tabernaaulaan This vord appears twice in the syncopated form,
tabernaclo, in Amph. l. i. 270, aya (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

In tabernaclo, id quidm lodt'e wmpuam paterii ariae,
‘md- Quid t'n tabernaclo senili l Va'ctrtr sum ri daleam

ln the second of these lines W must be pronounced as one

long syllable, but neither of them decide the quantity of the first .
syllable in tabernaada, which does not, as far as I know, occur in
any of the poets of the Augustan age. Taberna is found in several
passages in Plautus, but not one of these decides the quantity of the
first syllable, which is however unquestionably short in the Augustan
poeta. Terence affords no example. But in Trin. 111. ii. 100

(Troch. Tetr. Cat), we find-
Casrt'dent t‘n caput, darntla plactiie in tabernacula,

and this is the reading of all the MSS. Now this line, as it stands,
cannot be scanned unless upon the supposition that tabernaculo has ,
the first long. Hermann proposes to substitute amaberna'a, while
tt changes planae into plactilule, and thus scans ta tdlernlacttlla.
We meist therefore either adhere to the MSS. and suppose that
aberrantium has the first long; or, adopt canabam'a, as proposed
by Herm.; or else adopt the conj. emend, anama, and suppose
that sennaab has the second short Few will hesitate to conclude
that whatever the difficulties of the case may be, the remedy proposed
by tt is much more violent than the dismse, and that therefore we
have no evidence whatever of aviolation of the Rule of Position in
this case.

Taberna occurs six times in Plautus. In five of these passages
the first syllable may be long or short without affecting the verse.
The sinth instance is Pseud. IV. vii. 14 (Cret Tetr. i),

Nam me in abra usqtae adhuc saberet Surae.

lf the line is, as W. sets it down, a Cretic Tetrameter, aterna would
seem to be required 1 cannot however scon it comfortably as such,
but both the text and the arrangement of lines are very uncertain.
R. gives an unexceptionable Tetr.,

Nam t'n aterna usque adhuc anaor [ate] Surus,

but nte is not found in the MSS.; and even admitting¹ this reading,
the rst foot might be a Molossus.

Somewhat analngons, at first sight, to the case of tabernaculam is
abraames. Curc. 11. iii. 16 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
