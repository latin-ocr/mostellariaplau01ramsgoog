NOTES. Elim-144. 159

dsh'sr' S: arsacio lucri Vt Praenestinis conia est alanta. There are
some remarks upon this word in Aul. Gell. XVII. a, who quotes a
passage from Claudius Quadrigarius, 3ηά adds “ nunc arrabo in sor·
didis verbis haberi coeptae, ac multo rectius videtur arra, quamquam
arra quoque veteres saepe dixerunt et compluriens Laberius.”

116. Apsolne hunc, quaeso, nonanus] Unless uomt'tus be taken here
in a general sense to signify ‘filth,' it must mean ‘an emetic‚' ‘some-
thing causing sickness3' usually, however, it is employed to denote
the act of vomiting or the result. Thus Merc. Ill. iii. 14, Senex hir·
eones, tu osculere mutarunt Vtr'ne advenr'ens oomrhem exculr’as mulieri?
3ηά Rud. ΙΙ. vi. 26, L. Perri', antheo ntale fill conane, quaeso, capul.
C. Pulmoneum edepol mnes velun nonatum vonas, i.e. ‘it is all over
with me, I am sick, hold my head l beseeeh you! ‘Very much
should I like it if you were to retch up your lunga! Bothe 3ηά
Ritschl, offended apparently by this use of nonanes, have proposed
a correction which is no improvement. Weise in his index seems to

explain oomr'tus in this passage by argenlr'nunurallo. Does he mean ’

‘disgorge the money,' ‘up with itl’

rao. Adulescens] i. e. ‘young man,' is constantly employed by
dramatists in addressing and describing a person without reference,
at least emphatically, to his age. It is not employed when one
person accosts another ceremoniously, and occasionally, although by
no means uniformly, implies that the person addressed is in a social
position somewhat inferior to that of the speaker. It may thus be
often correctly represented by our phrase ‘my lad,' ‘my man,’ or
‘my friend! In like manner puer is the common term applied to
a slave, whatever his age may be; so in French a walter is called
garcon although he may be old and decrepit‚ and among ourselves
the same takes place with regard to post-boys. Inous early writers
Clrlde is applied to knights and squires, and in the plays and novels
of the last century chald is frequently used by ladies when addressing
full-grown women of 3 lower grade. ‘Ibe following examples of this
use of adulesems will suffice to illustrate what we have said: As. 11.

144. aa' usuum sanun] “Abundat unum‚'' and on Aul. 1. ii. 11
“Vox marn pleonastice adiecta ut saepius in Plauto,” says Weiss, a
most unsatisfactory explanation, one which ought ever to be regarded
with extreme distrust. There can be no doubt that in the older
forms of the language unus denoted not merely ‘one’ with numerica}
