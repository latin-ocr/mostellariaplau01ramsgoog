is placed Herculem sub terram πιεάιαυι cubantem: sub quem pluremum
aurum poectum est. ο. But the power ol the God was by no means
restricted within the narrow limits indicated above, lor we learn from
Diodorus Siculus and Dionysius os Halicarnassus, who enter into
minute details, that he was worshipped generally as the bestower οί
wealth, and that those who had accumulated great riches were went,
in gratitude or in the lulfilment ol ανον, to dedicate to him a tithe
ol all their possessions. It will be seen from the quotations given at
length below, that both authors carry back the origin ol this practice
to a remote mythical epoch—to the period when Hercules passed
over into Italy [rom Spain—and both distinctly state that it still
prevailed when they wrote. The former states specifically that
Lucullus, having calculated the amount of his fortune, consecrated
a tithe os the whole to Hercules, and expended the amount in a long
series of costly banquets, and this statement is corroborated by
Plutarch, who relates the same ol Sulla and of Crassus and proposes
as the subjectos one ol his Roman Problems (15), Διὰ τί κιρ Ἠρακλεῖ,
πολλοὶ τῶν πλουσίων ἐδεκάτευον τὰς ούσίας; These passages are so lm-
portant that they deserve to be quoted Alter having narrated the
hospitable reception oi Hercules by the aborigines who had a town
upon the Palatine, Diodorus proceeds (IV. ια), ‘0 δ’ οὖν Ἡρακλῆς
ἀποδεξάμενος τὴν εὔνοιαν τῶν ed Παλάτιον οἰκούντων, προεῖπεν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι
μετὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ μετάστασιν είς θεούς, τοῖς εύξαρίνοις ἐκδεκατεύσειν Ἡρακλεῖ
τὴν ούσίαν, συμβησεται ede βίον εὐδαιμονέστερον ἕξειν. δ καὶ συνέβη κατὰ
τούς ὕστερον χρόνους διαμεῖναι μέχρι τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς χρόνον, πολλούς γάρ

λοπλούτων τινδς, εὐξαμένους ἐκδεκατεύσειν Ἡρακλεῖ, καί μετὰ ταῦτα γενομένους

κολλος γὰρ δ τῶνκαθ’ αύτδν Ῥωμαίων σχεδόν τι πλουσιώτατος δν, διατιμησά-
μενος τὴν ἰδίαν ούσίαν, κατέθυσε τᾷ θεῷ πᾶσαν τὴν δεκάτην, εὐωχίας ποιῶν

τδν Τίθεριν ἱερὸν άξιόλογον, ἐν ᾧ νομίζουσι συντελεῖν τὰς ἐκ τῆς δεκάτης
decbr—where, it must be remarked, Diodorus speaks ol facts within
bis own knowledge and observation. In like manner Dionysius (A. R.
t 40) aiter reoounting the legend ol the erection ol an altar in honour
of Hercules by Evander andos the sacrifice of a tithe ol his spoils by
the hero himself, concludes with these words: ὀ te βωμὸς, ἐφ’ οὗ τὰς
δεκάτας ε’πίθυσεν Ἡρακλῆς, καλείτω μίν ύπδ Ῥωμαίων Μίγκστος, ἔστι δι’
Βοαρίας λεγομένης ἀγοράς πλησίον, ἁγιστευόμενος εί καί τις ἄλλος ύπὸ τῶν
ε’πιχωριάν. ὅρκοι τε γδρ ἐπ’ αύτῷ καὶ συνθῆκαι τοῖς βουλορίνοις βεβαίως τι
