31, 3²· We have printed these two lines in the corrupt and mutilated
form in which they appear in BCD. ln B there are several corrections
bya late hand. In v. 31 C has mei audis forme laudas, and D has dicet
sorderet, while the words Haubonumteneoservom are said to be legible in Α.
Camer. thus remodels the lines-

Qom melundas. Tr. Decet certe. Si. Certe hercle3 at ego te
Haud bonum teneo servom. Tr. Quid ita vero, Simo

lt is unnecessary to enumerate the conjectures of other scholam, all being
nlike mere ssights of imagination.

33. This line appears inacorrnpt form in the MSS. Aissaid to have
Hmunsrmrnnnuunamcunnno, the three letters below which we have

placed dots being very riunena. n nas an mastigia aa m wicram

reading. lt has been adopted by R ,who‚ however, have isti instead
of istic. In the Vulg. the line is placed at v. 71 of the preceding scene.
R places it at v. 52 os this scene.

by which Camer. engffivonred to fill up the blanks. ln v. 34 Α isJ said to
exhibit Qronsonnrmnllnc, and another line appears which has been

“ thus deeyphered-

lurusommnuslsclsrlnlouon . . . . sounnrlnltl.

BCDF agree, except that in v. 35 Dic is found in Bb only. B has Lic.
CDF have Hir, and in v. 38 CD have brevi, and CDF simul, while simul is
added as a correction ln B. Camer. Vulg. W. print ν. 40 as two lines-

Tr. Qridi ehem uix tandem ⁸
Percepi super his rebus nostris te loqur.
The last line is quoted by Festus (p. 305, ed. Meu), where we read
percipio and loqui te, omitting his.
