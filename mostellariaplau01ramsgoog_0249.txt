106 PLAVTI MOSTELLARIA.

58. Nisi te mala re magna mactari cupis] The verb macto deserves
particular notice. It seems to be derived from the same mot aa
magis and magnas, and to be a frequentative form of an obsolete
verb, mago, of which the participle mactus remained in use. 1. The
original signification of macto was ‘to magnify,' ‘to glorify,’ in the
sense of paying homage to a deity by offerings or sacrifices, and
thence was applied to men when exalted by honour. In this sense
it is constructed with the accusative of the object to which homage is
pald, and the ablative of the object employed to testify homage.
Thus, Cic. in Vat. Vl. l 14, Volo ut ma’kt' respondeas . . . quae tc tanta
pravitas mentr's tenuerit, qui molossum, ut, quum thaudr'ta ac nefartis
sacra eoeperit, quum t'ttserorum ammas elicere, qsusm pueromm extis
Deos Manes mactare soleas, διας and De Rep. 1. 43, Eos autem, qui
fn magrttratu pulsatorum slmiles esse velritt, eosque patratos, qui ffaant
nequtil mter prolatore et magestratum drfflrat,ferunt anolus et oractant
honoribus. So also Eun. Ann. IX. frag. 11. ed. Vahlen, Lzbfus zade
redit magno mactatus trr'umplto. a. Hence macto signifies simply, ‘to
offer in sacrifice,’ and is constructed with the accusative of the thing
offered, to which the dative of the obJect to which the sacrifice is
offered is sometimes added, Examples are very common, e. g.
Lucret 111. 52, Et nigras mactant peacda et Manibus mitri Iry'mas
mittunt ; Varro ap. Non. p. 341, Quod Kalendis Iuniis et publice et
probatem sarratam pultem Dr'is mactat,· again, passively, Hor. C. I. xix. 16,
Mactata uenit lenior bostra· and in Liv. X. 28, Decius exelsius, Iam
ego mecam hostziom lcgtones mactandas Telluri ac Diis Mamlus dabo.
3. We now come to that sense which is exemplified in our text, the
sense in which it is used almost invariably by Plautus,*-to magnify
with a bad or ironical force, ‘to load a person with missormne: and
is theu constructed with the accusative of the person and the ablative
of the word deuoting missortune. Thus we have in Aul. 111. v. 61,
Dotatae mactant et malo et damno νίνου and in a fragment of the
Amph, At ego certe cruce et eructata mactabo: exi, O,soras, mastogrit.
The expression is very frequently coucbed in the form of an impre-
cation, eg. Trin. IV. ii. 151, Ego ob ham operam argentum accepi:
te macto rasomono- and Bac. IV. viii 45, Et ego te et ille mactamus
risjortumo,· and so Cure. IV. iii. 5, Bac. Il. iii. 130, Poen. 111. i. 14.
This use of the word is by no means peculias to Plautus, for we read
in Ennius (frag. Teleph. V. ed. Vahlen), qui allum aa· aleaequs magno

⁴¹ We can scarcely consider Rud. l. its an exception, Si sapiam, hoe,

ysaod melmactat, concinnem lutum, where mactat means, is ‘tormentiug me,’ Ἰ
‘playmg the deuce wtth me!
