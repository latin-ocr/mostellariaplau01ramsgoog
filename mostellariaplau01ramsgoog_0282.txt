NOTES. ΙΙ. i. 1-10. ¹139

de‘er'r, Dinarehe, Er nosirem ef r'llorum velem. This use of vermis
not however confined to Plautus, but is found in Cicero, Livy, and
other writers.

9. Plagzpareiae] i. e. gui plagas pacientur: vox Plautina It
occurs again in Capt. III. i. 12, where it is applied to parasites, Nil
moraretur ihm Laconas, 2m2·s1pselliviros‚Phg2paeuas,qm·eus run! verba
sine penu et pecuum, i. e. ‘men of Spartan endurance.’ The word
is in form a patronymic, like repandae in Aul. ΙΙ. vii. &Responderunt
ubi mnium siet ia tiedrico, i. e. ‘children of the lash' Plautus uses
two other words bearing the same meaning: plagr'ger, Pseud. I. ii. ιι,
Huc adhibete aures, quoe ego loquor, plagigera genera homiaem, and
plagigerulus, below IV. i. 19, q. v. Plagiger and phgrgerulus are
both dtr. hey.

-Ferrr'iridax, a hybrid compound from ferrum and τρίβος the
pure Latin word is sentiemes, Trin IV. iii. ιι, oculicrepidae, creeri-
apeme, ferriteri, mastigiae. Ferrr'ferium, below 111. ii. 55 q. v. is
equivalent to Ergastulum‚ a place which is described in As. Ι. i. 21
as Apud fiestifredinas ferricrepinas e‘rerulas Vbi vehor domimo mortra‘
recursant bever. All the words given above, seminibus, serrr'terus,
serrr'ferium, serraliis, ferricrepinas, seem to be der. hey.

10. Fara] This word is thus explained by Non. p. 1143 “Foloe
turres sunt ligneae (Ennius Lib. XV„ ‘Malos definrdeni, firmi fabulata
solaeque.’) haec sunt in circo, quae apud veteres propter spectatores
e lignis erigebantur.” Again, Paul. Diae. p. 88, ed. Muli, “Foloe dicta
ab altitudine, a falando, quod apud Etruscos significat caelum;'' and
again, ib, “Falarica genus teli missile, quo utrmtur ex falis, id est locis
exstructis, dimicantes.” The salae in the Circus are alluded to by
Juv. S. VI. 590, Coruulit onte salar delphinorumque colamnas; and

· appear to have been not, as we might infer from the words of

Nonius, elevated wooden structures from which the spectatore viewed
the shows, but arow of seven wooden pillars which were ranged
along the spina, and on which were placed the ova, which marked
the courses See the commentators on the passage. The salarim is
well known from the description given by Livy XXI. 8 (see too
XXXIV. 14). See also Enn. Anu. 534, ed. Vahlen ς Virg. AEn. IX.
' 705, and note of Servius ; Lucan. VI. 19⁶3 Sil. Ι. 351, dec. There
is another word which some suppose to be derived from the same
source, viz. falere, found in Varro RR. 111. 5, § 1⁴ seqq„ but the
meaning of this term as there employed is very doubtful. With
regard to the etymology proposed by Festus it is difficult to offer

an opinion, but we can scarcely doubt that the same root appears in
