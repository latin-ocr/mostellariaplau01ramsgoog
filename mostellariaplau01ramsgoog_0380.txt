seen by referring to Heaut. IV. iv. 16, Hec. V. i. 27. ln Horace,
S. 1. ix. 41, although the imperative is not expressed it is implied
from the preceding clause.

ΙΙ. Sis and Saliis stand for si nr's and si 11111111 see passages
from Cicero and Festus quoted under Sodcs. We lind sci, although
rarely, in the uncontracted form: thus Adel. II. i. 30, Si salci ihm
dcbacchctus cs, Iena, audi, si vri, nunc 111111, dte.

Sis is generally subjoined to an imperative, and is frequently
connected with it so closely that the two words were, probably, in
the more familiar combinations, pronounced as one, and are so
printed: thus we find 01111111, caucsis, apugcszi‚ 1161111, and the like.
Sir however is occasionally separated from its imperative by a word:
thus, Cas. 11. vi. 27, Accipe 111111 1111 aud sometimes placed before
the imperative, asPers.1V. iv. 104, Ne, 111, plora, and V. ii. 15, Nc

. 111 me uno rugeio atlcgcrri.

According to the circumstances under which it is employed, and

to the tone of voice in which it is uttered, 11’1 may express feelings of
a varied description, just as the words ‘if you please,' ‘l’ll thank you,’
‘I’ll trouble you,’ in English, may express a civil request, a peremp-
tory command, anger, scorn, contempt, and many other emotions.
' Thus it denotes ordinary conventional civility in Cas. 111. vi. 20,
