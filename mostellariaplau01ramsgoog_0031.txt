xii PROLEGOMENA.

There is one correction, probably ol alate date, in the margin

mfflhg

alqnam Non miltisorle voum r'lico filil,
ie. aliqui legam nom. This appears to be the only example of a
correction in this hand in this play, and it is impossible to assign
a date to it either positive or relative: the inlr is rather pale.

Finally, there are here and there, especially towards the end ol
the play, some corrections and remarks written in black inlr in a
hand strongly resembling that ol Camerarius, and which have been
ascribed to him. Thus, in l. iii. 9 3, which appears in Β,

Mulier qaaere suornq glutem sperno speculo elusa erl,

where the a in elusa is written over an erasure, we lind in the margin
in the hand spoken of, ei uero est. These notes, by whomsoever
written, are evidently modern, and may be salely neglected by any
collator, however scrupulous. They are most numerous in Ill. ii,
and sometimes are a sort ol explanatory commentary, as in o. 26,

, Hoc holel repperi qui senon ἄντενιηι,
where we find, interlined above repperi, aetoliam and so in o. 51,

above qui is written quomodo as an explanation.
The following is a list ol the interpolations in red inlr by Came·

rarius in the Mostellaria:

ΙΙΙ. i. 6, 7, stands in B,
Danisla adest qui dodel,

Qui anaim dal empta quq’
Camer. completes the lines with argento senario arrd opus in triplus

Ta. (so written above)
Dixtin queso . ol'rri r'rrquam ordire ommia
Camer. has alque interlined above the words inquom ordire*
o. 23 stands in Β,
Negat? quom cogita.
Camer. correcta, T rr. Negat r'rrquom. Tre. perii oppilio, and an o in

red inlr over the a in cogita.
o. 24 stands in Β [with some scratehes below and above the

syllables ri con.-Er>.],
daiam si consessus sil

Camer. has Non confitetur? and then some scratches [the first being
apparently au erasure of the name lla. or Tra.-En.].
