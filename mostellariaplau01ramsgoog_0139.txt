cxii . PROLEGOMENA.

' Ex unoquoque e'orur‘n excurritur erenum pblndcrr‘um,

where the word must be scanned polentacium, although pilento lras
the first short in Ovid and Persius. But here we may observe that
qolentorr‘us is a word apparently coined by Plautus himself, and lound
in this passage only, nor is it used by any other author until we
corne down to Apuleius, and there is no reason why we should not
connect it with the kindred pollen. In so lar as the unsavoury jolre
is concerned, the readers of Rabelais will at once perceive that it
will lose nothing of its force if we derive the word directly srom
pollen, and not through the medium of polemo.

Suspicio, the substantive, with the second long, is frequently quoted
as an example of an anomalous quantity, because susptcu, the verb,
has the second short. But rrcrptcrb, the noun, occurs frequently in
Plautus and Terence, and has the second syllable uniformly long 3
it has the same syllable long in Martial and the later poets; and, as
lar as I lsnow, no example ol this word, with the second short, can
be quoted from any classical writer.

So also Rubrilus (from rbbeoe') occurs twice, Cas. I. v. 2, Stich. 1. iii.
77; coqulnotum (from coquinas), Aul. 111. i. 3, Pseud. Ill. ii. 64; and
coquinare, o. 85; but these words occur inverse in Plautus only,
and therefore we cannot compare his practice with that ol other
poets. Moreover, with regard to the first, the derivation ol ribulus
lrom rubeo is by no means certain; and with regard to the second,
we might be led to believe, from a passage in Paul. Diac. (p. 61,
ed. Muti), that the form used by Plautus was coquc'tcre, and not
coquinare.

Protcrous and its derivatives have the first syllable short in the
Augustan writers, as in the Horatian Choriambic,

Vrr'l grata protervitas,
and the Ovidian pentameter, ¹

Damnaret nolisocta protervo pater,
while in Plautus, Bac. IV. iii. ι (Troch. Tetr. Aean),

Feficlons protervo iracundo onemo, rndomr'lo, r'rccogr'loto, ’
and Amph. II. ii. 207 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),
Audacem esre, e! confidenter pro re et proterve loqui,

protervo and proterve must have the first long. When however we
remember the uncertainty and inconsistcncy which prevails in the best
writers as to the quantity of the first syllable oi words compoundcd
with pro, we need feel no surprise with regard to proteruus. . Α
