cviii PROLEGOhIENA.

with the first short, or pronounced ‘correptim' seems to rest upon
Stich. 1. iii. 60. T he following are additional examples from the
index of W.: Merc. 1. ii. 9 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), a line which in the
MSS. is corrupt, Men. V. ix.. 31, where also the reading is uncer-
tain, but without departing a hair-breadth from the MSS. we have-

Οειαηι hic tui est, tuque husus autem postea eandem putrium⁴ ·
ac pafrem.

R. has poste, but ponpa ean forms a Spondee. The *last ¹example
quoted is from Rud. ΙΙΙ. iv. 22,

Hae subm Veneri complacuerunt-Habeat, si argentum dabat,

on which W. has the note, “Hae non elidendum, autem vero corri-
piendum priori syllaba, quasi Hae utem? It seems positively perverse
to go out of the straight path in search, as it were, of a difficulty.
-Elide hae before autem, and the scansion is simple and obvious.

Ergo is another of, those words in which it is supposed that we
may occasionally pronounce the first syllable short, or the whole
word ‘correptim' Lind says, “De ergo correptim pronunciata non
dubitatum est, quamquam rara sunt exempla, veluti Mil. IV. ii. 17.''

The following are quoted as examples: Mil. IV. ii. 17 (Troch. Tetr.
Cat),

Ego hanc conanus uxorem ducam-Quali ergo hanc dubitas ’
conloqui? ’

So the MSS, except that B has Quid ergo hac, which would make
no difference in the scansion. The difficulty here however is not
confined to ergo, but we must make either aTrochee or a Spondee
out of Ego ham conltshuo. R. corrects-

Ego contritus uxorem hanc ducam—Ergo hanc quill, ec.

Again, quid ergo at the commencement of a Troch. Tetr. Cat,
Men. II. iii. 79, occurs in a corrupt passage. Ergo is not found in
any of the best MSS, and in any case the quid is probably the
word curtailed in the pronunciation. So Trin. IV. ii. 81 (Troch.
Tetr. Can),

Ne male loquere apsenti amt'co-Quz'd ergo ille ignavissumus.

So the MSS, Reiz. and R, Qstd tlte ergo. Pers. 1. i. 26 is called
a Troch. Tetr. Cat, but it cannot be scanned as such without the
omission of aword, and here again we have quid ergo. In Pers. ΙΙ.

ii. 3 (Troch. Tetr. Cat), we have again qut'd ergo. Stich. V. iv. 45
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),
