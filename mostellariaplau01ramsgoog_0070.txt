METRE AND PROSODV. li

wherever any obstacle presents itsell, a process literally Procrustean

is lorthwith resorted to, and short limbs are pulled out and long
limbs cut short without compunction.

lt, before going further, we endeavour to ascertain what the
ancients thought on this matter, we shall find that those who were
best qualified to judge were blind to the extreme slrill and grace
which some modern critics have discovered in the lambio Trimeter
ol the comio writers, and it is amusing to contrast the expressions
ol Cicero and Ritschl.

The former, Orat LV. i 184-“At comicorum propter similitu·
duem sermonis sic saepe sunt abiecti senarii, ut nonnumquam vix
ineis numerus et versus intelligi possit''

The latter, when arguing against the admission oi the hiatus under
certain circumstances, exclaims indignantly, “Et hoc ut artis fuerit?
et Plautinae artis, cuius tantam in reliquis partibus senariorum sep·
tenariorumque condendorum omnibus elegantiam merito admiramur l”
And yet Cicero was certainly familiar with, and greatly admired, the
early literature of his own country, and was moreover an accom-
plished Greek scholar. '

Again, Horace, although jealous perhaps of the blind admiration
evinced by some ol his contemporaries sor the older Latin writers,
would scarcely have ventured to attach the ‘numeri' of Plautus so
decidedly had they in reality been regarded generally as iaultless.
See Ep. 11. i 58, 170 sqq, A. P. 54, 270.

From Priscian we learn that even in his time there were persons,
we must suppose with some pretensions to learning, who asserted
that there were no metres at all iu Terence, while others pretended
that they were os a mysterious, recondite character, and known to
themselves alone. In the MSS. much confusion prevails as to the
arrangement ol lines, and the editor ol the Edrhh Prrhccps seems to
have been almost completely ignorant os the subJect, and in many
cases to have made scarcely an attempt to distribute the words ’
into verses.

Now although many difficulties present themselves when we
proceed to scan particular lines, and although much diversity os
opinion exista with regard to the precise laws which the damadsts
imposed upon themselves in constructing their verte, ll must be
observed that, except in some particular cases to be noticed below,
there is no more difficulty in determining the classes and species ol
verse employed than in the works os Virgil and Horace. We can

assert with absolute certainty ῑὴζῑῇῐοῐ the most part, the ordinary
