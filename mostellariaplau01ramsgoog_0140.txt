METRE ¹AND PROSODY. cxiii

Rudent has the first syllable short in Virgil-
Exorr'lur clomuque virum stridorque ridentum ,·

but in the following line of Plautus the first syllable must be long,
Rud. IV. iii. 76 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Mitte rudentem, sceleste l-rlfr'tlom, ortelle nudulum.

The word occurs again o. ι (Troch. Tetr. Cat), and o. 92 (Troch.
Tetr. Cat), but these passages do not decide the quantity of the
first syllable.

Nebula, which has the first short in the Augustas writers, is said
to have the first sometimes long and sometimes short in Plautus.
It occurs four times: in Pseud 1. v. 48 (senar), where, according
to the received reading, it has the first short; in Poen Ι. ii. 62
(Troch Tetr. Cat), where the reading is very doubtful, but that
adopted by the best editors admits of nebulae having the first short ;
in Cas. IV. iv. ar, where the distribution of the lines is entirely
arbitrary and uncertain3 and lastly, in Capt. V. iv. 26,

Nunc edepol derum ir memorabere regredior, quera cogito

Quoo' per nebulam, Hegionem putrem meum vocorrer,
where the speech of Tyndarus is slow and hesitating, as he strives
to recall the impressions of his childhood. Αιι actor therefore would
probably make a considerable pause after Quasi per nebulam, which
is itself a sort of parenthetic clause, and as even the most fastidiens
could scarcely insist upon the elision of the last syllable in nebulam,
it may therefore be regarded as a Tribrach.

Neute'quom. Neuter. Lindemann says that nmu‘quort is always a
Tribrach, and neultra pyrrich, by which he means, I presume, that
mulsum is always a quadrisyllable with the first three short, and
neuter a trisyllabis with the first two short. The examples whichl
find of these words are, capt 111. iv. 54 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Fruere ficum quod redimere se oe't, id neubpuonr muli placer,
where mutrguarn, according to my scansion, is uniquam Mil. ΠΙ.
ἰ 37 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

St' aldehaprllus ltr‘e vedetur mudeuurt ab r'ergenr'osf senex.
Here also morbusne ab form aTrochee. B. has aleres capellus,

C. albe· capellan but this makes no difference. Merc. 111. iv. 14
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Nunc quid restat, lei, dripere'i, voltu maguus leuius placet.
Here, if we conhoartatur as amonosyllahle, we might scan utiquam,
