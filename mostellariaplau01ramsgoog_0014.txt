intention, I have had to follow my own judgment, Ι will de·
scribe more particularly the condition of some portions of the
Ms as I found it.

The text, fortunately‚ was left in a completed state. Itis
founded almost entirely, as the reader will perceive‚ upon the
readings of the Vatican Mss, and especially B, with such
assistance as can be obtained from A, whose authority is of
course paramount in all those cases where its evidence is
available.

The critical apparatus has been derived partly from printed
editions, but also in part from an original collation of the
MSS. themselves3 and the chief value of this edition, in
a critical point of view, will be found in the circumstance
that in the winter of 1863-4, Mr. Ramsay spent several
months in making a carefirl collation of the Vatican MSS,
more particularly of B, having previously on his way to Rome
examined the celebrated Milan Palimpsest. 'Ibe result of
these labours is to be found partly in the· Prolegonsena, partly
in the critical notes, which embrace a considerable number ‘of

readings not recorded by Ritschl‚ and in some few instances
correct his errors. These additions and corrections, not in·

cluded in the copy of the text as Ι found it, have been incor-
porated by myself 3 and in several cases, where I felt uncertain
as to the exact meaning or reference of the MS. notes in my
hands, 1 was enabled to set doubt at rest by a careful personal
examinatior} of the Vatican MSS. in June, 1867, when I had the
satisfaction of testing the perfect accuracy of every statement
made in this edition as to the readings and condition of those
ln the matter of orthography‚ I found myself placed ina
considerable difficulty. It will be observed that in the Pro-
legomena the more important points of doubt in connection
with this subject are discussed at length, and in many cases a
decision arrived at as to the modes of spelling particular forms
and words, which we magnoni the evidence of inscriptions,
