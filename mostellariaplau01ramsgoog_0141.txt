cxiv PROLEGOMENA.

bnt it is more simple to make neutiquam hui a Spondee. The best
MSS. hare et er' instead of eei, hut this does not effect the scansion.
Poen. 1. i. 71 (Senar.)‚
Sine darnae magno quae elui muh'quam prust,
where neutiquam munt be adissyllable. These are the whole of the
examples in the Delphin index, and the same are giren in the index
of W„ preceded by the remark “ neutiquam prima correpta’' 1 think
1 am justified in asserting that neutr'quam is unisormly a dissyllable.
Now ior runter. Mere. 111. i. 4ο (lamb. Tetr. Cae),
Neuter struprn' canera caput limaret-Di inmortales!

where neuter ia a Spondee. Neuter is found also in Cas. V. iv. 3²
and Stich. V. iv. 51, but in both these passages the tent is so
uncertain that nothing can he founded on it. Iu Stich 1. ii. 84
(Troch. Tetr. Can),

Certumne est, neutram normarum persequi emperr'enn parrer
neutram is a Spondee ς so also in Mil. 11. v. 18 (Troch. Tetr. Can),
Ee ru et hic-Non nes neve'sh'd-Nentram-Metuo maxuma

Rud. 111. vi. 16 (Sanan),
Vtrum vah, epta, dnm lr'eett-Neutrum nolu·

and Frag. Viduland (apparently lamb. Tetr. Aean),
Ego servabo, quasi sequestro terh: neutri reddrdo drumm.
In Aul. 11. ii. 56 (Troch. Tet'r. Cat),
Neutrubr' habeam stabr‘le stabulum, si qnid dehortr'fuat, ’

neutrub' is a Trochee, as also in Men. V. ii. 35 (Troch. Tetr. Can),

Vt caneres neuter ad me iretis aem qnerr'rnonrh.

ln every case, therefore, in which neuter occurs, neuter may be
naturally scanned as a dissyllable and Spondee.

Amator. Weise quotes as examples 'oi amator with the first long,
Cas. III. iii a (Senon),

Hominem amatorem ullum ad serurn prmedere,

where surely it is quite aa good to malie the nst ioot a'lribrach as
an Anapaest 3 again, Epid. 11. ii 30 (Troch Tetr. Can),

Obviam ornatae occurrebant, n‘a‘s quaeque amatorr'bue,

where it is better to leave a hlatus after quaeque than to lengthen eim.

(It will be observed that sn‘Ts must he pronounced as a monosyllable.)
So in Mero. Ptol. 4 (Senon),
