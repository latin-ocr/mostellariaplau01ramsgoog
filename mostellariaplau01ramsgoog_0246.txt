NOTES. I. i. 35-43. ¹03

4ι. olere] The verse requires that we should shorten the
penultimate syllable. Priscian p. 838 recognises the double form
of this verb, and quotes the line before us as an example, ‘Oleo, oles,
et olo olis. Plautus in Mostellaria, Non omnes pessunt olere unguenta
exah'ea nam nisi corripias penultimam Iambus stare non potest’ He
quotes also a line of Afranius and repeats his observation in p. 866.
So Nonius (p. 147, s. v. alal) quotes the same line from Afranius as
an example ol alal, Nan poles! que'n illa stacta longeque et ιιιιιιιιι alate
and οιαιιι is found in Poen. Ι. ii 56. On the other hand, the
common form of the verb occurs in the next line, oles, and in Ι. ιιι.
ιιι, Quid oleon! mseras nisi ieiunum ιιι male alere e'rrlellegar, we must
have penultimate long, otherwise the trochaic measure would be
vitiated.

43. Neque lam facetrh, ptam ιιι venei, virumn] i. e. ‘delicate' The
idea originally involved in saceder has nothing to do with wit or
humour, but, supposing it to be derived from facab, is ‘dextrous,'
‘bandy' ‘clever,' ‘agreeable,' and it seems to be properly applied as
an epithet to anytlring done gracefully, indeed ‘graceful’ would in a
great number of cases accurately represent the meaning. We see

this force of the word exemplified in Hor. S. l. x. 44, molle atque
fircetum Virgilio annuerunl gaudentes rure Camenae ,· in Ep. Ι. vi. 55
it is equivalcnt to ‘affable' or ‘courteous' Frater, Perfer, adde; Vl cuique
ιιι aetas, ιἰα quemque facetus adopla; and in the sense of ‘graceful
delicate pleasantry’ with strong irony in Sat. 1. ii. 26, Maltln'nur

ιιιιιιιιι &mersu ambulat: est qui Inguen ad obscaenum subductis arque
sacelur; but when in Sat. Ι. iv. 7 he characterises Lucilius as sa-
cetres, Emunclae narr's, the meaning will be ‘elever’ or ‘witty and keen
scented! Even when applied directly to conversation facetius by no
means always implies humour; thus, when Cicero De Off. 1. 29
divides humour into two species (duplex rhcandigenus), he characterises
one of them as elegans, urbanum, rigaturum, facetum, where facetus
must signily ‘delicate' or ‘graceluL’ So also lustin. XXXIX. 25, speaks
of faceti ιἰιιι. Ιιι like manner facete in Plautus frequently significa
simply, ‘cleverly,' ‘agreeably,' ‘aptly,’ ‘to the 'purpose' Thus,
Asin. 111. ii. 35, Vr adsimulabat Sauream med erse, quam facete!
Capt. II. ii. 26, Vasacen oratrhnem ad serutlulem contulit,· Ι. ιι. 73,
H. Quia mi es! natalri dees, Propterea te vocari ad cenam valo.
E. Facete ιιιιιιιιιιι (somewhat different in Poen. III. ιιι. 24, where it
means ‘a well-expressed sentiment 3’) Mil. I. ι. 39, Facete advortis
antinum tuum ad antinum meum,· and 11. vi. 58, III. iii. 33, IV. iv. 5,
25. Pers. Il. v. ιι, S. Donrr'rrus me boves mercatum Eretriam ιιιιιιι,
