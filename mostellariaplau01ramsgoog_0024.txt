MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. ¹ v

numerous conjectural emendations carry conviction to our minda,
and have in the great maiority oi cases been acquiesced in as
certain, or at least acknowledged to be superior to those proceeding
from any other source. Although many ol the best scholare ol the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries busied themselves with Plautus,
and several examined again and again his MSS. with the most
anxious care-among whom we may name Fabricius, Lambinus,
Dousa, Taubmannus, Parcus, Gruterus, and Guyetus-and although
doubtless not a lew alterations and improvements were introduced
by these eminent men, still the result of their exertions, in com·
parison with those oi Camerarius, may be regarded as insigrriticant,
and the text as presented by him is essentially the same with that
exhibited in the Vulgate or Standard Recension, which was worked
up by Gronovius, and appears under its best form in the edition
printed at Leyden in 1684.

[Atthis point, alter remarking that little was done ior our author

others, was leit uncompleted. It will be seen abundantly from the
critical notes how often and how strongly he dissents from the arbi-

introduced for supposed metrical reasons-En]

St. Columbanus at Bobbio to the Ambrosian Library about the
beginning os the seventeenth century. An account of it was first
published by Angelo Mai, in 1815, in his “M. Accii Plauti frag-
menta raedam and it has since been carehrlly scrutinized by Ritschl,
Schwartamann, and others. The original writing was believed bl

Mai to belong to the age ol the Antonines, but may with greater
probability be ascribed to the fifth or sixth centini, and lt mltssi
be regarded as one ol the oldest, ii not the very oldest, specimen
in existence of any Latin classica] author. The superimposed writiug
belongs to the ninth century, and consists of ὅ Ρθῐῑὶθῐὶ oi the Old
