shouldn't wonder ii that fellow were either a robber or acm-pum!
Iu Trin IL iv. 94, alter Philto had been moralising upon the lot of

man, and declaring that rich and poor after they had passed into the
nether world were upon a complete equality as far as wealth was con-
cerued‚ Stasimus, according to the Vulgare text, is made to say, Mirm
πί tu illuc tecum dibrhbrseros, which cannot be explained according to
the view we have given os mr'rum ni. But the Milan Palimpsest gives
bere Anrnuuournw, and the Pali. MSS. (BCD) An mirum riu'to or an
melum ὑπ’ tu, while mr'rum m' is found only in the interpolated MSS.
and Ed. Prin. Hence there can be little doubt that R has restored
the true reading, Mirum quin tu illo tecum drbrizirrserar, i. e. ‘it is very
likely, isn't it, that you could carry your riches to the other world,'-
a contemptuous sneer, which is quite appropriate and in character.

70. Desom‘t rirscpultum clam] Clam and Palam are employed as
adverbs iu the sense ol ‘secretly' and ‘openly' and are olien directly
opposed to each other; thus Merc. V. iv. 63, Siquis prolr'bum‘t plus
perdet clam, quam si praehibuerit polana Clam is sometimes combined
with another adverb, as Poen. 111. iii. 49, Ar eruin hic clamfurtr’nr esse

“ volt. Clam, moreover, is in very many passages used as a prepositiou

governing the accusative, or the ablative, or, more rarely, the genitive,
and in this case signifies ‘without the knowledge ol' or ‘concealed
from the knowledge ol;' thus Cas. Prol. 51, Paterfilritsque clam atter
aderam, ‘the one without the knowledge of the other ς’ Most V. i. 13,
Nam scri> equidem nullo pacto iam erse porse clam renem, ‘that in no
way can the truth be concealed from ;' Merc. ΙΙΙ. ii. a, with the abla-
tive, Empta est ancia clam uxore meo et filio ,· Merc. Prol. 43, with the
genitive, Res exulahcm ad illam abr'bat clam patrii. So clam nte, Cas
1. i. 7, Rud. Ι. ii. 45, Heaut. I. i.'46, 66, Hec. 11. ii 10, 111. iv. 10,
lv. ii. 1; clam te, Andr. 1. v. 52, Eun IV. vii. 25, Heclv. iv. 59,
Phor. V. viii. 153 clam illum, lllerc. 11. iii. 263 clam uxorem, Aa lV. ii.
(ι, Cas. Prol. 54, 11. viii. 15, 32 ; clam ur’rum, Amph. Prol 107, Cas
ri, ii. 27. The choica of case seems quite arbitrary, lor we have
clam uxorem and clam or‘ro in the same sentence, Merc. IV. vi. 3, 5,
rr; anino distinction ol meaning can be drawn between clam patrm,
Merc. Il. iii, 83 clam patre, Troe. 11. i. 37 ; and clam patrii, Mero.
Prol. 43. Palem is not used as a preposition, but both clam and
palam, especially the latter, appear as indeclinable adjectives, signi·
fying respectively *secret' and ‘evident' or ‘open ;' thus Adel. Li.
46, Dum id rescr'tunr r'rr' credit, lantriper cavet: Si sperat fhrc clam,
rursus ad rirgenr'um redi‘, ie. ‘is he hopes that what he does will be
secret 3’ and hence focerealr'quril palam signifies not ‘to do something·
