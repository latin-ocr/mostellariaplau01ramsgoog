HISTORV OF THE TEXT. iii

’ ingenuity. This system was encouraged by those who lectured
publicly on Plautus, and who were compelled to submit him to their
auditore in a shape which could be understood. Hence each play
became encumbered with a mass of conjectural emendations and
arbitrary changes, many of them ingenious, some probably true, but
the greater number altogether preposterous. The object in view
was, however, accomplished, and editions of the different pieces
were circulated, readable indeed, but in which the genuine text was,
in innumerable passages, reclrlessly sacrificed. Whether this work
was performed by many hands, as is most probable, or by one
individual, possibly Poggio himself, as Ritschl believes, we are
unable to determine, hut the corrected pieces were certainly collected,
arranged, and combined before the end of the fifteenth century, and
thus arose a family of interpolated MSS, which became largely
multiplied, of which specimens are to be found in most of the
great libraries of Europe, and which, although differing in details,
all bear a general and even close resemblance to each other.

Τ110 Editio Princeps of the whole twenty plays was printed, as
noticed above, at Venice in 1472, the editor, being Georgius Merula.
ln his preface he repeatedly complains of the numerous corruptions
which had been introduced by the perversity of ignorant 0111111-
learned grammarians, and of the difficulty of procuring a faithful
transcript of the original MS. from which the last twelve plays had
been derived ς and it would appear that in so far as the Bacchides,
the Mostellaria, the Menaechmi, the Meter, and the Mercator were
concerned, he had been obliged to content himself with interpolated
copies, and that, in consequence, these plays were exhibited under
aworse aspect than the remainder.

For eighty years after the appearance of the Editio Princeps,
which was reprinted at Treviso in 1482, the text of Plautus under·
went little orno improvement Editions were published by Scutarius
of Veroelli (1490), by Saracenas (Venice, 1499), by Io. Baptista
Pius (Milan, 1500), by Ph. Beroaldus (Bologna, 1500), by Pylades
(Brescia, 1506, reprinted at Venice, 1511), by Ugoletus (Parma,
1510), and the two editions of Simon Charpentarius (Lyons pro·
bably, 1513, and Paris), and many others of inferior note. Nume-
rous changes were introduced by the whole of these, especially by
Pylades, who may be said to have remodelled the existing text, but
although some or 111 01 them may have had access to a correct copy

of D, and may have compared it with various interpolated MSS, 1¹0
