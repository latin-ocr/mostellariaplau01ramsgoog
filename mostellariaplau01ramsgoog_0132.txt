METRE ’ΛΝΒ PROSODY. cxiii

Rudent has the first syllable short in Virgil-
Exore'tur clamque orium stridorque eidem·

but in the following line oi Plautus the hrst syllable must be long,
Rud IV. iii. 76 (Trocln Tetr. Cat),

Mitte rudentem, recutiet-Mittam, ortelle vedrelunr.

The word occurs again nr (Troch. Tetr. Cat), and a. 9² (Troch.
Tetr. Cat), but these passages do not decide the quantity oi the
first syllable.

Nebula, which has the first short in the Augustan writers, is said
to have the first sometimes long end sometimes short in Plautus.
It occurs four times: in Pseud 1. v. 48 (Senar.), where, according
to the received reading, it has the first short3 in Poen. Ι. ii dt
(Troch Tetr. Cat), where the reading is very doubtful, but that
adopted by the best editors admits oi nebulae having the first short ;
in Cas. IV. iv. ar, where the distribution oi the lines is entirely
arbitrary and uncertain ς and lastly, in Capt V. iv. 26,

Nune edepol dnum in memorium regredior, pum cogite

Quasi per nebulam, Hegt'oeunt putrere mum vaureu,
where the speech oi Tyndarus is dcv and hesitating, as he anives
to recall the impressione oi his childhood An actor therelore would
probably make a considerable pause alter Quasi per netuhm, which
is inclusore oi parenthetic chose, and aa even the most lastidious
could scarcely insist upon the elision of the last syllable in nebulam,
it may therefore be regarded as aTribrach.

Neutr‘puam. Neuter. Lindemann says that neutbuam is always a
Tribrach, and neuter a pyrrich, by which he means, I presume, that
narsem is always a quadrisyllable with the first three short, and
neuter a trisyllable with the first two short. The examples whichl
lind oi these words are, Capt 111. iv. 54 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

liliisne trum quod redemere se ael, id numquam melei placet,

where neutonam, according to my scansion, is neutonam Mil. 111.
i 37 (Troch Ten. Cat),

Si alh'coptilur tic ordiar nnmpuam ab r'ergeniort reerex.
Here also unusquam ab ionn aTrochee. B. has adue capellus,

C· albicapillus, but, this makes no difference. Mera 111. iv. 14
(Troch. Teu. Cat),

Nune quidemst, lei, dripert'i, volso semiputata iuius placet.
Here, iiwe condierimus as amonosyllable, we. might scan dameam,
