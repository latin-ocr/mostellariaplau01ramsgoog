in such words ss accusabis, ooo, navisnoous, tro, the two syllables

Bene rionis agulalru, pulcre haec confertur ratim
Aul. IV. vii. 3 (senar),

Fac mentionem cunt Maelo, matr meas
Asin. Ι. iii. 65 (Troch. Tetr. Cat.)‚

Acus adsuescunt. Necesse estsacere sumptum qui quaerit lucrum,

where aves is a monosyllable and necesse est a dissyllable; 11.ii. 105
(Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Mox quom Saureon imitabor omo ne siccaneas,

where caveto is pronounced cauto.

There is a curious passage in the Truculentus, 111. ii. 15, where

Stratilax enunciates cavillator as caullator, and Astaphium ridiculos
him lor his pronunciation‚

S. Heus tre, cam postquam in urbem crebro commeo,

Dr'cax sum sactus: cam sum cavillator (i e. caelator) probam

A. Quid td est, mnodo? Istaecce ridentiano

Cavillatc'ones vis sortasse deiero.

S. Ita, ut pauxillum dfflerant α capillulis (ie. radulti or
caulibus, ‘cabbages ’).

The well-known story in Cic. Div. 11. 40 serves to illustrate the
popular pronunciation os cave. There was a town in Caria called
Caunus, famous sor its figs, which were imported into Italy and
hawked about, the cry used by the vendors being Cauneas! When
Crassus was embarking his troops at Brundusium, previous to his
fatal campaign against the Parthians, he encountered one ol these .
itinerant dealers, and Cicero says it might be urged by the super·'
stitious that il he had been warned by the omen he might have
escaped destruction 3 Cauneas and Cave ne aar being, it would appear,

identical in pronunciation.
So with the word absentem Amph. 1. i. s (lamb. Tetr. Aeas),

Iuoc‘nlulis mores quisnam, quihoc noctis solus ambulem,
