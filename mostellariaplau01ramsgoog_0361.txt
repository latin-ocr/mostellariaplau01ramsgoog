aske with whet malady the patient to whom he hod been called ie
affected, on which the old man replies testiiy, Qru‘rr ea le cereso daco
ul e'd dieas melli, ‘why,l tell you,1 am taking you to him ior this
very reason, diet you may tell me what his malady is! Impatienoe

Queir is affirmative in Merc. II. iii. 77, Hercle, quin lu recle dt'cis el
lele' mentem ego, ‘by Hercules, but thou sayest weliz' we have the
seme phrase again, V. iu. 47, Men. 11. iii. 74, and, slightly varied,
in V, ix. 33, Hercle quin lu me admonuisti recle, el liabeo graleu
It denotes strong affirmation in Poen IV. ii. 86, S. Pryeelo ad iu
cites haman rediget sl eos aleuxm'e. M. Qma peries deipeelblljaxo,

Frequently quin is not a simple affirmative, but edds something
which gives greater soree or emphasis to the question or remark oi
the preceding speeiem thus Most 11. ii. 25, Tre ,ln lu auguill has

Ila ego illum cum eura ego magna curalo leil. The ,commentatore heve
missed the sense ol this passage; there is a pun on the double
meaning oi cure, which may signify, as in English, either simply
‘diligence' oi ‘mental anxietyz' S. ‘I wish him to be cered sor with
