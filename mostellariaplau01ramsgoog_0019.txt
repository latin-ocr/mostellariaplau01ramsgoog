xii PREFACE.

from the general analogy of the Latin language, and the lan-
guages derived from it, will have the greater weight.

The Notes and the Excursus speak for themselves; the latter,
it will be observed‚ as well as the Prolegomena, refer to the
plays of Plautus generally, and have no special application to
the Mostellaria„ Whether either are as full as they were
intended ultimately to be, Ι have uno meansof judging.

In conclusion, I have only to say that by the most 'careful
verification of references throughout, I have done everything
in my power to ensure accuracy in points of detail. The
edition to which the references have been uniforrrrly made to
apply is the Vulgate, as represented in the Delphin edition. In
the case of the Mostellaria, the reference to the text of the
present edition, where it differs from the Vulgate, is appended
within brackets.
