xcviii snonseontsrvn. '

So the MSS. Guyetus and R. get rid of the difficulty by transposing,
and have rhlro modo.

We occasionally find violent transgressione of quantity depending
upon a single example; thus Aul. 111. ν. 42,

Sirophr‘arr‘r' adamat adstant remr'ronurri',

where, if we retain the Vulgate, we must shorten the two first
syllables in slmtmnunil Nothing is more likely than that a cor-
ruption should be found in this passage, where there is along string

of strange words invented apparently for the nonce. Bothe bas pro·
posed a simple emendation—

Strophrimi' stant, stant semr'rorrurr‘r',

but the word remansura· itself is very doubtful.

[Having thus shown that little orno reliance can be placed on
the above examples as affording evidence that the early dramatists
had no scruple in violating the Rule of Position, wherever it srrited
the exigencies of their verse to do so, we will proceed to give a few
examples of lines containing one or other of the two classes of anoma-
lies referred to above, p. lxx, and which we have sufficiendy indicated ’
are in our opinion to be scanned hythe process called ‘correption’
that is, by slurring over and running together two syllables into one,
rather than by an indiscriminate neglect of the fundamental Law of
Pontion-En]

I. Under class r, consisting chiefly of dissyllables with ashort
penultimate, we may instance the following :-

Apud must be pronounced as a monosyllable in Epid. 111. iv. ¹4
(senar,

Memorare! apra} reges armr'r arte ὠιιΙΙιὶα,

where it will be observed that the two first syllables of droellria suffer ¹
synizesis; again, in Amph. 111. ii. 66 (Sanan),

Vt quae a'pfu'd &gairum volu vovi si domum
Other instances will be found in Capt. I. ii. 90, Cure. 11. iii. 66, Most.

l· lZ'rrrlmlis a monosyllabis Trin. 1. ri. ²3 (Senam),

Namque ενι-ῆι tu credo m1l2·2·mprudmtiobrepnris.

So the MSS.; Camer. has numquam em'm, and R. correcta nempe
mehr. ln Trin. l. iii. 77 (Senar.) we have both enr'm and mirari as

monosyllables,
lta fanum-At ιῖιιῖι n‘u‘n'n longo sermone alentur.
