lxvi PROLEGOMENA.

Either oi the long syllables oi the Cretic may be resolved, aad in
this way the iourth Paeon (υ υ υ -) and the first Paeon (- υ υ υ)
become admissible, thus-

Fourth Paeon in aad,
Masi’ce hercle tgtas nitatem ria ut oos decet.
Fourth Paeon in 3rd,
Nos pressaio probe ut vdliinnis venantia.
fourth Paeon in rst and first Paeon in 3rd,
mann indiligens riddirc ollas nevolt.

But, in addition to these ieet, the Romans (not the Greeks) admit
the Molossus. This doctrine was first distinctly laid down by Bentley,
in his notes on Cic. Tusc. 111. 19, and Terent. Adel. lV. iv. a*

Examples are common-

ln rst and and,

Vino et victi piscine probo electili.
In rst and 3rd,
Procisserunt ita ut dicis sacta haud nego.
ln rat, audead 3rd,
V'enit navis ndstrde ndvi quoe srdngot ratem,

where nanti is to be pronounced as a monosyllable.

Generally speaking, the Cretic vindicates to itself the eth place,
but even into this the Molossus and the fourth Paeon occasionally
intrude, but not the first Paeon.

According to what has been said the scheme of the Cretic
Tetrameter licat. will be·-

There is another point connected with the scansion of Cretic
Tetrarneters which deserves special attention, via, that the two halves
are Asynartete, and thus the last syllable oi the second ioot may

* lt is admitted, somewhat grudgingly, by Hermann, with a qualification
not very precise nor easily applied-“ qui pes tamea ita temperari solet, ut
aut propter ambiguitatem mensurae nou sit molossus, ut in Plauti capum
ΙΙ. i. 1¹3 aut solutos sinat, quos argento emerit, vel ubi concede hac, secede
huc, et similia retracto in primam syllabam accentu dicuntur; aut a pro·
nuntiatione accentum solum sequente obscuretur, ut in Rudente l. v. 1519,

Quaene eiectae e mari ambae summ, te opsecro
Vt tao recipias tecto, cavesque nos.”
