said ‘rhstlr'aler'ff Adel. V. viii. a, D. Ego uero rubeo, el aa lac re, el
alti's amathas Quam maxuuu unam facere mar lanc famulam, Colere,
adauuare, adiungere. A. Ila quaeso, paler. M. Haud alzler censeo.
D. lma hercle ita nobis decet: here tino indicates an exception taken
to the word censeo as too leeble: M. ‘My sentiments are the same.
D. ‘Nay, (‘cauea' is not the word, this is not a matter os opinion or
sentiment) it is our duty ;' Eun. V. ii. 33, C. A! nunc dulim spero
aelernam aar mos gratiam Fore, llari: saepe ex hueiumodi re quapiam
el Malo premam'o magna familiaritas Conflata ert: quid si loc quis·
piam oolual Decus? T. Equidem pol in eam partem aca‘ptaque et volo.
C. Ima ila quaeso: here amo refers to the words accepto el uolo as
contrasted with the more eamest quaeso. We may th'us paraphrase
the passage: T. ‘Assuredly 1 arn ready to view the matter under this
aspect (ie. as intended by the Gods to establish ‘aeterna gralia*

ι between us) and Ι arn willing that such may be the result! C. ‘Nay,

(‘ ready and willing’ are not the words) 1 implore the Gods that this
may came to pass!

When amois employed to correct and strengthen‚ it may frequently
be translated by ‘nay, more;' Adel. 111. iv. 36, H. Hunc abduce,
ama', quaem rem. G. Ima hercle extorque, ‘nay, more (take stronger
mensures still), wrench the truth out ol him by torture ;’ Eun. ΙΙΙ. ν.
14, A. Narra titur, quaeso, quad siet. C. Into ego le opsecro hercle ut
audias, ‘nay, more, (not only will 1 tell you as you request‚ but)I
implore you to listen;' Phor. V. viii. 58, N. Salis tibi esll P.. Ima
uero pulcre discedo mprobe Et praeter spem .· here tino refers to salt'r:
‘nay, more than that (not only am I content, but) 1 come off glo·
riously and beyond my expectations;' Heaut. IV. viii 11, M. Erraor':
rer acla: quanta de spe decadi! C. Ima, haec quidm, quae apud me
erl, Chlophom's estAmica, ‘nay (that is not all), more thau that;’ so
in Phor. V. viii 54, amo means ‘nay‚ more, I have not done yet ;‘
Aut IV. x. 51, L. Filiam ex u lu habes. E. Ima, ecallam domi:
here, at first sight, we might suppose that rino was equivalent to
simple ‘yes‚' but the true force is ‘nay, more than that, not only

have I'a daughter, but she is there in my house even now ;' Hec. V.
iv. 29, Pamphilus (a. 26) enjoins silence upon Bacchis (mque opus est
adeo maliolo), who replies, Into elram hoc qui occuliari sacellus credas,
dabo, ‘nay, more, (not only will 1 keep the secret) hut lwill supply

you with information‚’ &o See other examples oi tino elram in
Andr. IV. i. 31, 50, ii. 25, Phor. V. vi. 37, in all ol which ‘nay more'
isthe proper translation.

This force of inm is well developed in the Bacchides 11. ii. 27.
