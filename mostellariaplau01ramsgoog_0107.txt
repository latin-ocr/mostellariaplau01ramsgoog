lxxxviii PROLEGOMENA.

suum, u. ιι ,
Nlcm si ille huc saluos revenit reddam ιιῖιιῖιι sibi.

The letter ιι coalesces occasionally with the vowel following in the
words duo qualum· both forms, dreis and ιιι-οι, occur in the same pas-
sage in Most. 111. ii. 147 (145) and 149 (147) (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

where we must pronounce dtus as amonosyllable: duodeviginh' may

in the other a Spondee ; Most. III. i. 121 (117) (senar),
Quat& quadraginta illi debentur mium.
ln Men. 1. iii. aa, 23 (Troch. Tetr. Cat),

Quutuhr mihis ego emi illunc amo uxori meae
Qudluw ruthae perurunt plane, ul ratio redditur,
it will be observed that quatuor is a trisyllable with the first

syllable long. Ι
Fuit is a monosyllable Truc 11. i. 7 (lamb. Tetr. Cat),

Dum suit, dedit: nunc achil halec: quod habebat, nos habemus.

We have thus seen that the principle of synizesiu of which we find
occasional examples in the mitings os the Augustali poeto, was em.
ployed to a iar greater extent, and in amueh holder manner, by the
early dramatists. But Ritschl, while in his eagerness to establish the
purity and correctness ol the meires os Plautus he would deprive
him os those licences in which the most lastidious versifiers have
indulged, is in some particulare willing to grant him an amount ol
license from which the most careless would have shnmk. Iu sup-
