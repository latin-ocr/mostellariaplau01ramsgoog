Into si scier is acombination in which titre is said to have some·
times the soree oi ‘yes' used as a direct affirmative. But if we
examine carefuily the passages referred to, it will be found that they
have not been interpreted correctly: thus Eun. ll. iii 61, Parmeno
is describing to Chaerea the giit presented to Thais, C. Quis is est
lam poem cum ionio munere hec) Ρ. Miles lleraro Phaedrrhe rivalis.
C. Duras fratris portes prodam Ρ. Into emin si scios quod meare

you state my brother has a lnrd part to play! P. ‘No, no, (it is
too soon ior you to spealr ol that, what 1 have mentioned is a
mere trifle,) ior if you were to know what gift your brother is
providing in opposition to this git, you would have better grounds
for saying so! ‘Yes’ is, at first sight, the natural translation os
r'rno in this passage, but emin is introduced to explain why Parmeno

S. Imo si series, Sed porro ausculta quod superesi fallaciae, ‘nay, (not
so fast, say not so yet) is you were to know all (you might say so),
but listen,' drc.

The following passage from the Andria, IV.ii. 25, presents con·
siderable difficulty, and is quoted as an example os rino signiiying

C. Quid me siet? It will be seen that Davus declares that he has so
much to do that he has no time ior explanations, and tells the young
