- bacche] So haeccrire, acc. pl. neut. a. ²43 locam, acc. sing. neut.
a. πός bocaico neoda, a. 25.

ια. frraex] ie ‘you dunderhead! Frutex properly signifios ‘a
shnrb’ or ‘dwarf tree,’ also ‘the stalle of a plant? There is atine in
Terence, Heaut V. i. 4, which may serve as a commentary, In nee
qmdor's harum rerum canam‘i Quae sunt dicia in statam, caudex, str'pes,
mina, pluralem, and we ourselves talk of a sellow as being ‘a poor
stick’ or ‘a perfect sticki* R. has adopted the conjecture oi Guyetus
and has introduced rupere into his text, a word quoted by Festus
’ (s. v. Squarrasos, p. 329, ed. Muli.) from Lucilius, and which, as we
gather from Aul. Gell. (xiii. 9) and Tertullian (De Pall 4, with note
of Sahnasius, Apol. αι, Dc Anima, ό), signifies ‘an ignorant boor!
Since all the best MSS. agree in frutex, no change is necessary.

14· deliciae popli] This in the English edition oi Forcellini is
rendered, ‘the sport aud diversion of the people‚' but it means
rather ‘the darling oi the people‚’ ie. ‘of society! This is the
sense of dele'cicu in Catull. 11. 1,Passer deliciae meae puellae,· and so
in Plautus, Poen. 1. ii. 152, vce find it in a string of endearing
appellations, Mea voluptas! meae deliciae! mea vela! mea amomr'iar!
Mera aelius! meum labellum! ntea saltui meum mavelim Maera mel!
meum cor! ntea colostra! meres atollr'crdus casam and so in Pseud.

arim· Pers. 11. ii. aa, Paegnium, delthae puerr‘, salve (⁶ you darling,
derling boy) ; and Stich. V. v. 1, Morere vobis geram, auae delr‘crhel
aud we have several examples in Cicero. We shall have occasion to

Ι say more about this word in the note on IV. iii 9 in this play. In

Asin V. ii. 35, Salapiam in deiceris pollam auam habri, ie. ‘which
she loves so much!

¹5· Rus melei ta obiicias] ie. ‘do you cast the country in my
teethl' The Scotch phrase, ‘to cast up a thing to any one‚’ i. e. ‘to
reproach any one with a thing;' is still more close. Belou, in
utu rar, Aee caoe lu illi abc'ecler nuere in aegritudine Te has emisse, ⁸
‘do not taunt hirn' (remind him). The phrase is varied in Truc.
11.ii. 25, Rur lu melei opprobrari ui nacla es homiaem quem pudeat
probri. With regard to the contemptuous use os rus we may corn-
pare Truc 11. ii. 14, Rus maure tec quedem eri, ‘this is rustic
coarseness in perlection,’ ‘this is a pure specimen of a coarse country
clownss

⁴¹ Lapis is used in the same sense, Merc. lll iv. 46, egomet credidi

< Homini docto rem mandare, is lapidi mondo maxumo.
