lt is natural to conclude that the soltening os prepositions in
composition by assimilation should have become more and more
general as the cultivation of the language advanced, but it is a
deeided mistake to suppose that the practice was altogether unknown
in early times. The statement of Pierius, in his note on the line
(Virg. Aen, IV. 175), Mobslilate vaget vz'resqua αᾱᾳιιίνιῖ eundo, “Antiqua
pene omnia exemplaria integras servant praepositiones in compo-
sitis, ut adquam: et ita scn'bi solitum usque ad Aurelii Antonini Pii
tempora, publica declarant monumenta.’' can be at once disproved
by many os the “ publica monumenta ” to which he appeals, Setting
aside the change of ab, ob, into ap, op, dn, oi which we shall speak
below, and which may depend upon different considerations, we find
in 7ACCVMVLAV1; ACCIPIO and its tenses are used in early
inscriptions to the exclusion ol the harder adopto, and occur in
11, 12,14,16 quater, lo qmtrqmts, 20 bis, and also in n. 818 tis and
8193 so ACCVSASSE [20], ATINGAT, ATTIGAT‚ ATTIN·
GAT, ATTIGERET [12], AVFERATVR [18 bis]‚ COMVO-

mssa: [10], COMVALEM [1a]‚ COMPORTENT [14].

These examples are quite sufficient to disprove the broad asser-
tion that assimilation was unknown until the time of Antoninus Pius,
but on the other hand it is unquestionable thatin early inscrip-
tions, in the great maiority os cases, prepositions in composition
undergo no change. Thus we have ADFERATVR, ADSIGNARE,
ADSIDVO, ADTRIBVERE, CONLATA, CONLEGA‚ CONLE·

GrvM, CONLEIBERTVS, CONLOCARE, CONPLVRIBVS,
CONPROMESISE, CONRIGI, DISMOTA, EXDEICENDVM‚
lNGNOMINIAE, INMITTERE‚ INMORTALlVM‚ INPEDITVS,
INPONITO, INPROBARINT, INPROBVM, INPVLSVM, IN-
ROGARE, and others.

Iu a few ceses there seems to have been uncertainty3 thus we lind
CONFLOVONT and COMFLVONT both in 18, INPERIVM*
and its cases in 11‚12‚14‚ 1MPER10 [10], INPERARE [14], ·
INPERATO [18], IMPERATOR [20], and unilormly in all

in the spelling oi this word and its compounds is dwelt upon and an
explanation suggested-En] .
