MANUSCRIPTS OF PLAUTUS. vii

fasciculi or quaterniones, described above, which were numbered
xa, xm, xm, mn, 3ηά 3 lew pages 01 mv. 01 xa, xm, no portion
remains, and the Palimpsest does not become available sor this play
until we reach the second leaf 01 mr (ΙΙΙ. 1. 45). Altogether eight
leaves or sixteen pages remain 01 xnu, xant (i. e. one-half 01 xm
and one-half 01 run), more or less legible, but the leaves 01 xurv,
which contained the continuation 01 the play from V. ii. 11 to the end,
are lost. The MS. was written, like all those belonging to an early
period, in large, distinct, well-executed capitals; the lines in the
lambio Senarians and Septenarians ‚were correctly divided, but the
Trochaic and Iambic words which make up a line are not divided,
the letters being written continuously. When the dialogus passes
from one character to another at the beginning 01 3 line, there is no
mark to indicate this, but when such a change takes place in the
middle 01 3 line, then a blank space, such as would be occupied by
two letters, is leit, which it was probably intended to fill up with the
initial 01 the name in red inlu In like manner the soenes are divided

from each other by a blank space sufficient to contain two lines 01 ’

writing‚ and this in like manner it was intended should be filled up
with the names 01 the personages who took part in the action 01
the scene in question.

B. Itu Vetas Codex Camerorr'ri*

From the hands 01 Camerarius this MS. passed into the Palatine
Library at the beginning 01 the seventeenth cennrry, was conveyed to
Rome in the year 1622, and is stillpreserved in the library 01 the
Vatican among the Palatine MSS. and nurnbered 1615.

The writing belongs to the eleventh century, and extends over
213 sheets of vellum in moderate-sized solio. It contains the whole
01 the twenty extant plays 01 Plautus, together with the title 01 the
Vr'dalarat subjoined to the Truculentus, while prefixed to the Am·
phitruo we find the Querolrar.

The work, which sor the most part is coarse and irregular, appears

to have been executed by a number 01 different hands, and in ink 01
different colours. Not unfrequently the scribe has been changed more
than once in the oourse 01 3 single play. This is especially conspicuous
in the case 01 the Persa, where we can distinctly trace five, ii 110t ⁸1¹,
different hands, several leaves being written in ink which has faded 10

Rhein. Mus. (Welck. and Naelr.) vol. iv, p. 5¹¹ sqq· ²¹¹⁶ l>- 535 sqq.
